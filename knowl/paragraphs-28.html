Note that the adjective “linear” specifies that the unknown values must be linear terms, which means that each unknown variable cannot be raised to a exponent, be an exponent, or buried inside of a <span class="process-math">\(\sin\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\cos\)</span> function. Luckily, most unknowns in equilibrium are linear terms, except for unknown angles. If you are not familiar with the use of linear algebra matrices to solve simultaneously equations, search the internet for <em class="emphasis">Solving Systems of Equations Using Linear Algebra</em> and you will find plenty of resources.</div> <div class="para"></div> <div class="para">No matter how you choose to solve for the unknown values, any numeric values which come out to be negative indicate that your initial hypothesis of that vector’s sense was incorrect.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_05-3d-rigid-body-equilibrium.html#paragraphs-28" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
