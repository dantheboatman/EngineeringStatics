  <title>Rigid Body Equilibrium</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
			This chapter will investigate the equilibrium of simple rigid bodies like your book, phone, or pencil.
			The important difference between rigid bodies and the particles of <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> is that rigid bodies have the potential to rotate around a point or axis, while particles do not.
		</p>
    <p>
			For rigid body equilibrium, we need to maintain translational equilibrium with
			<men xml:id="SigmaF1">\sum \vec{F}=0
			</men>
			and also maintain a balance of rotational forces and couple-moments with a new equilibrium equation
			<men xml:id="SigmaM1">\sum \vec{M}=0
			</men>.

    <title>Degree of Freedom</title>
    <p><em>Degrees of freedom</em> refers to the number of independent parameters or values required to specify the <em>state</em> of an object.
		</p>
    <p>
			The <em>state</em> of a <em>particle</em> is completely specified by its location in space, while the state of a rigid body includes its location in space and also its orientation.

				Two-dimensional rigid bodies in the <m>xy</m> plane have three degrees of freedom.
				Position can be characterized by the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> coordinates of a point on the object and orientation by angle <m>\theta_z</m> about an axis perpendicular to the plane.
				The complete movement of the body can be defined by two linear displacements <m>\Delta x</m> and <m>\Delta y</m>, and one angular displacement <m>\Delta \theta_z</m>.

    <p>
			For a body to be in static equilibrium, all possible movements must be adequately restrained.
			If a degree of freedom is not restrained, the body is in an unstable state, free to move in one or more ways.
			Stability is highly desirable for reasons of human safety, and bodies are often restrained by <em>redundant</em> restraints so that if one were to fail, the body would still remain stable.
			If the restraints correctly interpreted, then equal constraints and degrees of freedom create a stable system, and the values of the reaction forces and moments can be determined using equilibrium equations.
			If the number of restraints exceeds the number of degrees of freedom, the body is in equilibrium but you will need techniques we won't cover in statics to determine the reactions.

			Free body diagrams are the tool that engineers use to identify the forces and moments that influence an object.
			They will be used extensively in statics, and you will use them again in other engineering courses so your effort to master them now is worthwhile.
			Although the concept is simple, students often need help to draw them correctly.
		</p>
    <p>
			Drawing a correct free-body diagram is the first and most important step in the process of solving an equilibrium problem.
			It is the basis for all the equilibrium equations you will write; if your free-body diagram is incorrect, your equations, analysis, and solutions will also be wrong.
		</p>
    <p>
			A quality free-body diagram is neat, clearly drawn, and contains all the information necessary to solve the equilibrium.
			You should take your time and think carefully about the free-body diagram before you begin to write and solve equations.
			A straightedge, protractor and colored pencils all can help.
			You will inevitably make mistakes that will lead to confusion or incorrect answers; you are encouraged to think about these errors and identify any misunderstandings to avoid them in the future.

      <title>Creating Free Body Diagrams</title>
      <p>
        The basic process for drawing a free-body diagrams is
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>Select and isolate an object</title>
            <p>
							The <q>free-body</q> in free-body diagram means that the body to be analyzed must be free from the supports that are physically holding it in place.
						</p>
            <p>
							Simply sketch a quick outline of the object as if it is floating in space disconnected from everything.
							Do <em>not</em> draw free-body diagram forces on top of your problem drawing <mdash/> the body needs to be drawn free of its supports.
						</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Select a reference frame</title>
            <p>
							Select a right-handed coordinate system to use as a reference for your equilibrium equations.
							Even if you are using a horizontal <m>x</m> axis and vertical <m>y</m> axis, indicate your coordinate system on your diagram.
						</p>
            <p>
							Look ahead and select a coordinate system that minimizes the number of unknown force components in your equations.
							The choice is technically arbitrary, but a good choice will simplify your calculations and reduce your effort.
							If you and another student pick different reference systems, you should both get the same answer while expressing your work with different components.
						</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Identify all loads</title>
            <p>
							Add vector arrows representing the applied forces and couple moments of acting on the body.
							These are often obvious.
							Include the body's weight if it is non-negligible.
							If a vector has a known line of action, draw the arrow in that direction; if its sense is unknown, assume one.
							Every vector should have a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead indicating its direction.
						</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Identify all reactions</title>
            <p>
							Traverse the perimeter of the object and wherever a support was removed when isolating the body, replace it with the forces and/or couple-moments which it provides.
							Label each reaction with a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead.
							Again, if a vector's direction is unknown just assume one.
						</p>
            <p>
							The reaction forces and moments provided by common two-dimensional supports are shown in <xref ref="reactions-from-supports-2d"/> and three dimensional support in <xref ref="reactions_table_3D"/>.
							Identifying the correct reaction forces and couple-moments coming from supports is perhaps the most challenging step in the entire equilibrium process.
						</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Label the diagram</title>
            <p>
							Verify that every dimension, angle, force, and moment is labeled with either a value or a symbolic name if the value is unknown.
							Supply the information needed for your calculations, but don't clutter the diagram up with unneeded information.
							This diagram should be a stand-alone presentation.
						</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
				Drawing good free-body diagrams is surprisingly tricky and requires practice.
				Study the examples, think hard about them, do lots of problems, and learn from your errors.

      <title>Two-dimensional Reactions</title>
      <p>
				Supports supply reaction forces and moment which prevent bodies from moving when loaded.
				In the most basic terms, forces prevent translation, and moments prevent rotation.
			</p>
      <p>
				The reactions supplied by a support depend on the nature of the particular support.
				For example in a top view, a door hinge allows the door to rotate freely but prevents it from translating.
				We model this as a frictionless pin that supplies a perpendicular pair of reaction forces, but no reaction moment.
				We can evaluate all the other physical supports in a similar way to come up with the table below.
				You will notice that some two-dimensional supports only restrain one degree of freedom and others restrain up to three degrees of freedom.
				The number of degrees of freedom directly correlates to the number of unknowns created by the support.
			</p>
      <p>
				The table below shows typical two-dimensional support methods and the corresponding reaction forces and moments supplied each.

          <shortdescription>The table shows different supports and the corresponding number of unknown reactions.
					Normal supports (one unknown): force perpendicular to the surface.
					These supports include smooth surface, roller, rocker, pinned collar on a smooth rod, smooth pin in roller or slot.
					Two-force member supports (one unknown): tension or compression force in line with the two force member.
					These supports include a cable, a weightless link, or a spring with force F = k*delta (linear spring constant multiplied by the change in length from unstretched).
					Pin support (two unknowns): Two rectangular force components or one force at an unknown angle).This support is generally is a frictionless pin or hinge.
					Rough surface support (two unknowns): friction and normal forces or magnitude and direction of resultant force.
					This support type is a body contacting a rough surface.
					Fixed collar support (two unknowns): normal force and couple moment.
					This collar slides but cannot rotate.
					Fixed
					support (three unknowns): two rectangular force components and couple.
					This support is generally welded, bolted, or otherwise anchored.</shortdescription>

				The main added complexity with three-dimensional objects is that there are more possible ways the object can move, and also more possible ways to restrain it.
				The table below show the types of supports which are available and the corresponding reaction forces and moment.
				As before, your free-body diagrams should show the reactions supplied by the constraints, not the constraints themselves.

          <shortdescription>As in the previous table, support types are shown here.
					A support produces a reaction in the direction in which it prevents motion (1 reaction).
					Two-force support member constrains translation in one direction.

					Ball and socket constrains translation in 3 directions, but not rotation (3 reactions).
					Free axle bearing constrains translation in two directions (y and z) and rotation in two directions (couple moment about z and about y) (4 reactions).
					Confined axle bearings (e.g., thrust bearing, smooth pin, hinge) only allows rotation about one axis, and does not allow translation in any direction (5 reactions).
					A square axle bearing only allows translation in one direction, and no rotation (5 reactions).
					A fixed support prevents any translation or rotation (6 reactions).</shortdescription>

				One new issue we face in three-dimensional problems is that reaction couples may be <term>available</term> but not <term>engaged</term>.
			</p>
      <p>
				A support which provides a non-zero reaction is said to be engaged.
				Picture a crate sitting at rest on a horizontal surface with a cable attached to the top of the crate.
				If the cable is slack, the reaction of the cable would be available but not <em>engaged</em>.
				Instead, the floor would be supporting the full weight of the crate.
				If we were to remove the floor, the cable would be engaged and support the weight of the crate.

          <shortdescription>A box hangs from the ceiling by a cable.
					It rests on a flat surface.
					Therefore, the tension in the cable would be zero, and the T is not engaged.
					In the second image, the box hangs from a cable from the ceiling.
					It does not rest on a surface.
					Thus the tension T in the cable is nonzero, i.e.
					it is engaged.</shortdescription>

				To get a feel for how reaction couples engage, pick up your laptop or a heavy book and hold it horizontally with your left hand.
				Can you feel your hand supplying an upward force to support the weight <em>and</em> a counter-clockwise reaction couple to keep it horizontal? Now add a similar support by gripping with your right hand.
				How do the forces and couple-moments change? You should have felt the force of your left hand decrease as your right hand picked up half the weight, and also noticed that the reaction couple from your left hand was no longer needed.

				The vertical force in your right hand engaged instead of the couple-moment of your left hand.
				The reaction couples from both hands are available, but the vertical forces engage first and are sufficient for equilibrium.
				This phenomena is described by the saying <q>reaction forces engage before reaction couple-moments</q>.

				Given that there several options for representing reaction forces and couple-moments from a support, there are different, equally valid options for drawing free-body diagrams.
				With experience you will learn which representation to choose to simplify the equilibrium calculations.

    <p>
			In statics, our focus is on systems where both linear acceleration <m>\vec{a}</m> and angular acceleration <m>\mathbf{\alpha}</m> are zero.
			These systems are frequently stationary, but could be moving with constant velocity.
		</p>
    <p>
			Under these conditions <xref ref="second-law" text="custom"> Newton's Second Law for translation</xref> reduces to
			<men xml:id="SigmaF2">\sum \vec{F} = 0
			</men>,
		</p>
    <p>
			and, <xref ref="second-law-rotation" text="custom"> Newton's second law for rotation</xref> gives the similar equation
			<men xml:id="SigmaM2">\sum \vec{M} = 0
			</men>.
		</p>
    <p>
			The first of these equations requires that all forces acting on an object balance and cancel each other out, and the second requires that all moments balance as well.
			Together, these two equations are the mathematical basis of this course and are sufficient to evaluate equilibrium for systems with up to six degrees of freedom.
		</p>
    <p>
      These are vector equations; hidden within each are three independent scalar equations, one for each coordinate direction.
      <mdn>
        <mrow xml:id="scalar-eqns">
          \sum\vec{F} \amp= 0 \implies \begin{cases}\Sigma F_x \amp= 0\\ \Sigma F_y \amp= 0 \\ \Sigma F_z \amp= 0\end{cases} \amp \sum\vec{M} \amp= 0 \implies \begin{cases}\Sigma M_x \amp= 0\\ \Sigma M_y \amp= 0 \\ \Sigma M_z \amp= 0\end{cases}
        </mrow>
      </mdn>
      Working with these scalar equations is often easier than using their vector equivalents, particularly in two-dimensional problems.
		
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    </p>
    <p>
			In many cases we do not need all six equations.
			We saw in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> that particle equilibrium problems can be solved using the force equilibrium equation alone, because particles have, at most, three degrees of freedom and are not subject to any rotation.
		</p>
    <p>
			To analyze rigid bodies, which can rotate as well as translate, the moment equations are needed to address the additional degrees of freedom.
			Two-dimensional rigid bodies have only one degree of rotational freedom, so they can be solved using just one moment equilibrium equation, but to solve three-dimensional rigid bodies, which have six degrees of freedom, all three moment equations and all three force equations are required.
		</p>

  <section xml:id="Chapter_05-2d-rigid-body-equilibrium">
    <title>2D Rigid Body Equilibrium</title>
    <p>
      Two-dimensional rigid bodies have three degrees of freedom, so they only require three independent equilibrium equations to solve.
			The six scalar equations of <xref ref="scalar-eqns"/> can easily be reduced to three by eliminating the equations which refer to the unused <m>z</m> dimension.
			For objects in the <m>xy</m> plane there are no forces acting in the <m>z</m> direction to create moments about the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> axes, so the reduced set of three equations is
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \{1\} \amp = \begin{cases} \sum F_x \amp =0 \\ \sum F_y \amp =0 \\ \sum M_A \amp =0 \end{cases} 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      where the subscript <m>z</m> has been replaced with a letter to indicate an arbitrary moment center in the <m>xy</m> plane instead of a perpendicular <m>z</m> axis.
		
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not the only possible set of equilibrium equations.
			Either force equation can be replaced with a linearly independent moment equation about a point of your choosing <fn>Labels <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> in these equations are representative.
			They don't have to correspond to points <m>A</m>, <m>B</m> and <m>C</m> on your problem.</fn>, so the other possible sets are
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \{2\} \amp = \begin{cases} \sum F_x \amp =0 \\ \sum M_B \amp =0 \\ \sum M_A \amp =0 \end{cases} \amp \{3\} \amp = \begin{cases} \sum M_C \amp =0 \\ \sum F_y \amp =0 \\ \sum M_A \amp =0 \end{cases} \amp \{4\} \amp = \begin{cases} \sum M_C \amp =0 \\ \sum M_B \amp =0 \\ \sum M_A \amp =0 \end{cases} 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      For set four, moment centers <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> must form a triangle to ensure the three equations are linearly independent.
		
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    </p>
    <p>
			You have a lot of flexibility when solving rigid-body equilibrium problems.
			In addition to choosing which set of equations to use, you are also free to rotate the coordinate system to any orientation you like, pick different points for moment centers, and solve the equations in any order or simultaneously.
		</p>
    <p>
			This freedom raises several questions.
			Which equation set should you choose? Is one choice <sq>better</sq> than another? Why bother rotating coordinate systems? How do you select moment centers? Students want to know <q>how to solve the problem,</q> when in reality there are many ways to do it.
		</p>
    <p>
			The actual task is to choose an efficient approach and carry it out.
			An efficient solution is one which avoids mathematical complications and makes the problem easy to solve.
			Complications include unpleasant geometries, unnecessary algebra, and particularly simultaneous equations, which are algebra intensive and error prone.
		</p>
    <p>
      So how do you set up an efficient approach? First, stop, think, and look for opportunities to make the solution more efficient.
			Here are some recommendations.
      <ol>
        <li>
					Equation set one is usually a good choice and should be considered first.
				</li>
        <li>
					Inspect your free-body diagram and identify the unknown values in the problem.
					These may be magnitudes, directions, angles or dimensions.
				</li>
        <li>
					Align the coordinate system with at least one unknown force.
				</li>
        <li>
					Take moments about the point where the lines of action of two unknown forces intersect, which eliminates them from the equation.
				</li>
        <li>
					Solve equations with one unknown first.
				</li>
      </ol>

					The force at <m>B</m> is drawn along its known line-of-action perpendicular to the roller surface, and drawn pointing up and right because that will oppose the rotation of the frame about A caused by load C and moment D.
					The force at <m>A</m> is represented by unknown components <m>A_x</m> and <m>A_y</m>.
					The sense of these components is unknown, so we have arbitrarily assigned the arrowheads pointing left and up.
				</p>
        <p>
					We have chosen the standard coordinate system with positive <m>x</m> to the right and positive <m>y</m> pointing up, and resolved force <m>A</m> into components in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions.
				</p>
        <p>
          The magnitude of force <m>B</m> is unknown but its direction is known, so the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components of B can be expressed as

					This is a good example of an inefficient solution because of all the algebra involved.
					The issue here was the poor choice of <m>B</m>, <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> as moment centers.
					Whenever possible you should take moments about a point where the line of action of two unknowns intersect as was done in solution one.
					This gives a moment equation which can be solved immediately for the third unknown.

			Three-dimensional systems are closer to reality than two-dimensional systems and the basic principles to solving both are the same, however they are generally harder solve because of the additional degrees of freedom involved and the difficulty visualizing and determining distances, forces and moments in three dimensions.
		</p>
    <p>
			Three-dimensional problems are usually solved using vector algebra rather than the scalar approach used in the last section.
			The main differences are that directions are described with unit vectors rather than with angles, and moments are determined using the vector cross product rather scalar methods.
			Because they have more possible unknowns it is harder to find efficient equations to solve by hand.
			A problem might involve solving a system of up to six equations and six unknowns, in which case it is best solved using linear algebra and technology.

      <title>Resolving Forces and Moments into Components</title>

				To break two-dimensional forces into components, you likely used right-triangle trigonometry, sine and cosine.
				However, three-dimensional forces will likely need to be broken into components using <xref ref="Chapter_02-unit-vectors"/>.

      <p>
        When summing moments, make sure to consider both the <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments and also the couple-moments with the following guidance:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
							First, choose any point in the system to sum moments around.
						</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There are two general methods for summing the <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments.
							Both techniques will give you the same set of equations.

                  <p>
										For relatively simple systems with few position and force vector components, you can find the cross product for each non-parallel position and force pair.
										Using this method requires you to resolve the direction of each cross product pair using the right-hand rule as covered in <xref ref="Chapter_04"/>.
										Recall that there are up to six pairs of non-parallel components that you need to consider.

                  <p>
										Choose a point in the system which is on the line of action of as many forces as possible, then set up each cross product as a determinant.
										After computing the components coming from each determinant, combine the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> terms into each of the <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_x=0</m>, <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_y=0</m>, and <m>\Sigma\vec{M}_z=0</m> equations.

				Once you have formulated <m>\Sigma\vec{F}=0</m> and <m>\Sigma\vec{M}=0</m> equations in each of the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> directions, you could be facing up to six equations and six unknown values.
			</p>
      <p>
				Frequently these simultaneous equation sets can be solved with substitution, but it is often be easier to solve large equation sets with linear algebra.
				Note that the adjective <q>linear</q> specifies that the unknown values must be linear terms, which means that each unknown variable cannot be raised to a exponent, be an exponent, or buried inside of a <m>\sin</m> or <m>\cos</m> function.
				Luckily, most unknowns in equilibrium are linear terms, except for unknown angles.
				If you are not familiar with the use of linear algebra matrices to solve simultaneously equations, search the internet for <em>Solving Systems of Equations Using Linear Algebra</em> and you will find plenty of resources.

      <title>Determinate vs.
			Indeterminate</title>
      <p>
				A static system is <term>determinate</term> if it is possible to find the unknown reactions using the methods of statics, that is, by using equilibrium equations, otherwise it is <term>indeterminate</term>.
			</p>
      <p>
				In order for a system to be determinate the number of unknown force and moment reaction components must be less than or equal to the number of independent equations of equilibrium available.
				Each equilibrium equation derives from a degree of freedom of the system, so there may be no more unknowns than degrees of freedom.
				This means that we can determine no more than three unknown reaction components in two-dimensional systems and no more than six in three-dimensional systems.
			</p>
      <p>
				An indeterminate system with fewer reaction components than degrees of freedom is <term>under-constrained</term> and therefore unstable.
				On the other hand, if there are more reaction components than degrees of freedom, the system is both <term>over-constrained</term> and <term>indeterminate</term>.
				In terms of force and moment equations, there are more unknowns than equilibrium equations so they can't all be determined.
				This is not to say that it is impossible to find all reaction force on an over-constrained system, just that you will not learn how to find them in this course.

      <title>Stable vs.
			Unstable</title>
      <p>
        A body in equilibrium is held in position by its supports, which restrict the body's motion and counteract the applied loads.
				When there are sufficient supports to restrain a body from moving, we say that the body is <term>stable</term>.
				A stable body is prevented from translating and rotating in all directions.
				A body which <em>can</em> move is <term>unstable</term> even if it is not currently moving, because the slightest change in load may take it out of equilibrium and initiate motion.
				Stability is loading independent
        <ie/>
        a stable body is stable for <em>any</em> loading condition.

      <title>Rules to Validate a Stable and Determinate System</title>
      <p>
				There are three rules to determine if a system is both stable and determinate.
				While, the rules below can technically be checked in any order, they have been sorted from the quickest to the most time consuming to speed up your analysis.

          <p><em>Rule 1:</em> Are there exactly three reaction components on a two-dimensional body?
					</p>
          <p>
						If YES, the system is determinate.
					</p>
          <p>
						If NO, the system is indeterminate or not stable.

          <shortdescription>Three scenarios are shown.
					An L shaped beam has one end against a wall on the left and the other end against the ground.
					In the first scenario, the top left end is a roller resting against the wall, and bottom right end is a fixed pin connection.
					This has 3 unknowns and is determinate.
					The next scenario has both ends with fixed pin connections.
					This has 4 unknowns and is indeterminate.
					The final scenario has bot ends with roller connections.
