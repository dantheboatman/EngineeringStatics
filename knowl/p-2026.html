<em class="alert">Unwind-with-load screw</em> As its name implies, an unwind-under-load screw will start turning unless a moment <span class="process-math">\(M''\)</span> is applied to keep the screw at or beyond impending motion. The moment to push a self-locking screw to impending motion <span class="process-math">\(M'\)</span> is in the opposite direction as the moment to keep unwind-under-load screws at impending motion <span class="process-math">\(M''\text{,}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(M''\)</span> is in the same direction as the moment to loosen (or raise) a screw. These unwind-with-load screws are not often found in mechanical systems, except for in dynamic motion control systems, where the screw is used to slow down motion.</div>
