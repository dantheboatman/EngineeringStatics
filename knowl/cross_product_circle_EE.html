Curved blue arrows are drawn from i to j to k (counter-clockwise) and indicated as the positive (+) direction). An outer circle is formed by red curved arrows that are drawn from k to j to i (clockwise) and indicated with the negative direction. For example when you cross i with j you are going in the positive (counter-clockwise) direction around the blue inner circle and thus the answer is +k. But when you cross j into i you go in the negative (clockwise) direction around the circle and thus get a âˆ’k. Remember that the order of cross products matters. If you put the vectors in the wrong order, you will introduce a sign error."><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">2.8.5<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Unit vector cross product circle.</figcaption></figure><span class="incontext"><a href="cross-product-math.html#cross_product_circle_EE" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
