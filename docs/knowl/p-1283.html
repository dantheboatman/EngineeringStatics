<div class="para">All of the free-body diagrams we have drawn are correct, though not all are necessary. Generally we only draw the free-body diagrams needed for the solution. These diagrams form a chain which connect the known input forces to the desired output forces. When solving frames and machines, think carefully about what you know and what you need to solve for: that determines which free-body diagrams you will need. Taking a few moments to consider what unknowns youâ€™d have at each step can help you optimize your problem-solving effort.</div>
