<div class="para">This law applies to multi-body systems wherever one body connects to another. At any interaction point, forces are transferred from one body to the interacting body as equal and opposite action-reaction pairs. These forces cancel out and are invisible when the structure is intact. Only when we cut through a member or joint in the isolation step of creating a free-body diagram, do we expose the interaction forces. When drawing free-body diagrams of the components of structures, it is critically important to represent these action-reaction pairs consistently. You may assume either direction for one, but the other <em class="emphasis">must</em> be equal and opposite.</div>
