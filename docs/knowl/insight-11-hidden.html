<div class="para">The controlling design parameter for most engineering systems is deformation. Thankfully, due to a property called elasticity, most materials will bend, stretch, and compress, long before they ultimately break. For example, when designing the floor in a new building, the floor is often limited to deflecting less than the length of the span in inches, divided by 360. Any more deformation than this would be considered disconcerting to the building residents and also start damaging surface materials like drywall. For example, for a <span class="process-math">\(\ft{20}\)</span> span, the deflection would need to be less than</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\delta = \dfrac{\ft{20} \cdot \dfrac{\inch{12}}{\ft{1}}}{360}=\inch{0.667}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para"></div> <div class="para">To meet this deformation limit, we need to consider the magnitude and location of applied loads, the size and shape of the floor beams, and the material the floor beams are made from. As deflection is an internal property of the flooring materials, the first step is to determine the internal forces that arise from the externally applied loads, using the methods of this chapter.</div></article></body>
