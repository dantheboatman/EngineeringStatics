</h3>In <a href="graphical_method.html" class="internal" title="Section 8.7: Graphical Method">Section 8.7</a> we used the mathematical relationships between loading, shear, and bending moment to draw shear and moment diagrams directly. The method is quick and requires only a few simple computations to determine the critical values. The approach provides many cross-checks for accuracy. It is most suitable for beams loaded with concentrated forces, concentrated moments, and uniformly distributed loads, but is not usually suitable for more complex distributed loads. It is essential to have a solid grasp of the integral and differential relations between loading, shear and moment discussed in <a href="VM_relations.html" class="internal" title="Section 8.6: Relation Between Loading, Shear and Moment">Section 8.6</a> to use this method.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_08-summary.html#li-554" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
