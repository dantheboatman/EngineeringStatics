  <title>Friction</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Friction is the force which resists relative motion between surfaces in contact with each other.  </p>
    <p>Friction is categorized by the nature of the surfaces in contact and the conditions under which they are interacting. <ol><li><term>Dry friction</term>, which is the force that opposes one solid surface sliding across another solid surface.</li><li><term>Rolling friction</term>, the force that opposes motion of a rolling wheel or ball.</li><li><term>Fluid friction</term>, is the friction between layers of a viscous fluid in motion.</li><li><term>Skin friction</term>, also called drag, is the friction that occurs between a fluid and a moving surface.</li><li><term>Internal friction</term>is the force resisting the internal deformation of a solid material.</li></ol></p>
    <p>An understanding of friction is important factor in the design, functionality and performance of many mechanical systems. So far, we have only looked at situations where friction could be safely ignored; however, there are many cases where the effect of friction is significant.  These include slipping or tipping, blocks, wedges, screws, belts, bearings, and rotating disks. These are the subject of this chapter. </p>

    <introduction>
      <p>Dry friction, also called <term>Coulomb friction</term>, is a force which appears between two solid surfaces in
        contact. This force is distributed over the contact area and always acts in whichever direction opposes 
        relative motion between the surfaces. We will usually simplify the distributed frictional force by representing
        it as a single concentrated force acting at a point, as we did in <xref ref="distributed-loads"/>.</p>
      <p>Depending on the details of the situation, dry friction will either hold the object in equilibrium, in which case it is called <term>static friction</term>, or it will retard but not prevent motion, in which case it is called <term>kinetic friction</term>. In <em>Statics</em> we are only concerned with objects in equilibrium so we will focus on static friction, and kinetic friction will be studied in another course. </p>
      <p>Consider the football training sled shown in <xref ref="sled_AA"/>. Initially, the sled's weight is supported by a normal force acting on the bottom surface that can be considered as a point force directly beneath the center of gravity; there is no friction force. </p>
      <p>When players begin to push the sled, a friction force will appear along the bottom surface which opposes sliding to the right. Both the friction and normal forces can be represented by concentrated horizontal and vertical forces located to the right of the center of gravity. This offset is required to maintain rotational equilibrium against the pushing force. If the players push hard enough, equilibrium will break and the sled will begin to slide in the direction of the push. At this point static friction has transitioned to kinetic friction.</p>

        <p>The force distribution on the bottom of an object being pushed across a surface is complex, and looks approximately like (a).</p>
        <p>To simplify things, we first decompose the actual force into a distributed <em> normal </em> force perpendicular to the surface, and a distributed <em> friction </em> force parallel to the surface, as shown in the (b). These two distributions are further simplified into two concentrated forces representing the normal and friction components of a single resultant force, as show in (c). The net resultant force acts at the point required for equilibrium.</p>

      <title>Coulomb Friction</title>
      <p>The Coulomb friction model proposes that the force of friction is proportional to the normal force, where the
        normal force is the force acting perpendicular to the contacting surface. <me>F_f = \mu N</me>The constant of
        proportionality, <m>\mu</m>, is called the friction coefficient. <m>\mu</m> is always greater than zero and
        commonly less than one. The friction coefficient can be greater than one for materials that exhibit positive adhesion to each other like silicone rubber, glued surfaces, or gecko’s feet.</p>

      <p>Friction has two distinct regions as shown in <xref ref="coulomb-friction"/>, and the value of <m>\mu</m> is different in each region. The region from point one to point two, where the force of friction increases linearly with load is called the <term>static friction</term> region. Here you must use the <term>coefficient of static friction</term>
        <m>\mu_s</m>. The region from point two to point three, where the friction remains roughly constant is called the <term>kinetic friction</term> region. In this region you must use the <term>coefficient of kinetic friction</term>
        <m>\mu_k</m>. </p>
      <p>The coefficient of friction suddenly drops at point two, causing the friction force <m>F_f</m> to drop as well.
        Point two is called the point of <term>impending motion</term>, because here the frictional force suddely drops
        aand the object begins to move.</p>
      <figure xml:id="coulomb-friction">
        <caption>Phases of Coulomb friction.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/coulomb-friction"/>
      </figure>
      <p>To better understand the behavior of Coulomb friction imagine an object resting on a rough surface as shown in <xref ref="friction-slide-fbd"/>.  When force <m>P</m> is gradually increased from zero, the normal force <m>N</m> and the frictional force <m>F_f</m> both change in response. Initially both <m>P</m> and  <m>F_f</m> are zero and the object is in equilibrium. The interaction between the two surfaces in contact means that friction is available but it is not engaged <m>F_f=P=0</m>.</p>
      <p>As <m>P</m> increases, the opposing friction force <m>F_f</m> increases as well to match and hold the object in equilibrium. In this static-but-not-impending phase <m>F_f= P</m>. </p>
      <p>When <m>P</m> reaches point two, motion is impending because friction has  reached its maximum value. <m>F_{f_\text{max}}=\mu_\text{s} N = P</m>. If force <m>P</m> increases slightly beyond <m>F_{f_\text{max}}</m>, the friction force suddenly drops to the kinetic value <m>F_f= \mu_k N</m> .   the applied force exceeds the frictional force breaking equilibrium and causing the object to accelerate, and accelerating bodies are are beyond the scope of Statics!</p>
      <p>Notice that friction force at impending motion  is always greater than kinetic friction, because the coefficient <m>\mu_\text{s} \gt \mu_k</m> for most materials. Practically, this tells us that once a material starts to move it is easier to keep moving than it was to get it started from rest. </p>
      <p>If you wonder why we include kinetic friction in a statics course, remember that a sliding body moving at constant velocity is in equilibrium.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_09-friction-angle-and-friction-resultant">
      <title>Friction Angle and Friction Resultant</title>
      <p>Recall that a resultants is the sum of two or more vectors. The <term>friction resultant</term> is the vector sum of
        the friction and normal forces. Since these two forces are perpendicular, the
        magnitude of the friction resultant can be found using the pythagorean theorem. 
        <men>R = \sqrt{F_f^2 +
          N^2}</men></p>
      <p>The <term>friction angle</term>
        <m>\phi_s</m> is defined as the angle between the friction resultant and th normal force.   At impending motion, the friction angle reaches its maximum value. The friction resultant and friction angle are used for screw, flexible belt, and journal bearing type problems.</p>
      <p>The fmaximum friction angle <m>\phi_s</m> is directly related to the coefficient of static friction <m>\mu_\text{s}</m> since the friction angle <m>\phi_s</m> is the internal angle of the right triangle formed by the normal force <m>N</m> , the friction resultant <m>R</m> , and the friction force <m>F</m>. Hence:
      <men>\tan \phi_s = \frac{F}{N} \qquad \phi_s = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{F}{N} \right)</men></p>
      <p>In <xref ref="resultant-force"/> a block of weight <m>W</m> is pushed sideways by force <m>P</m>. The reaction forces can be represented as separate friction and normal forces,  or as combined friction force ( <m>R</m> ) acting at friction angle <m>(\phi_s)</m>, measured from the normal direction.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_09-normal-forces">
      <title>Normal Forces</title>
      <p>The normal force supporting the object is distributed over the entire contact surface,however, it is common on two dimensional problems to replace the distributed force with an equivilant concentrated force acting at a particular spot on the contacting surface, as we did in <xref ref="Chapter_07"/>.  This point is rarely at the exact center of the contact surface.</p>
      <p>This is illustrated in <xref ref="ggb-distributed-normal-force"/> where we see in that an object at rest has a uniformly distributed normal force along the bottom surface and the resultant normal force is located directly below the weight. The friction force is not engaged. When a pushing force <m>F_\text{push}</m> is applied, the distributed normal force changes shape, and the resultant normal force <m>N</m> shifts to the right to maintain equilibrium. The resultant normal force continues to shift to the right the harder you push.</p>
      <p>This can be understood from the principle of a two-force body. The combined push and weight can be represented a single load acting down and to the right. The  friction and normal forces can be combined into a single reaction force acting up and to the left at a point on the bottom surface. These two forces must share the same line of action to maintain equilibrium, so as the pushing force increases, the friction angle changes and the point shifts to the right .If the point shifts off the physical object then the required friction is greater than the friction available and motion begins.</p>

    <p>This section focuses on the various ways a rigid body in equilibrium might begin to move. The point at which an object starts to move is called the point of impending motion.</p>
    <p>The interactive in <xref ref="ggb_slip_tip"/> shows a box sitting on a rough surface. Imagine that we start pushing on the side of the box with a gradually increasing force. Initially, friction between the block and the incline will increase to maintain equilibrium, and the box will sit still.</p>
    <p>As we continue to increase the force there are two possibilities; the maximum static friction force will be reached and the box will begin to slide, or the pushing force and the friction force will create a sufficient couple to cause the box tip on its corner.</p>

      <xi:include href="interactives.ptx" xpointer="ggb_slip-tip_interactive"/>
    </figure>
    <p>The easiest way to determine whether the box will slip, tip, or stay put is to solve for the maximum load force
      <m>P</m> twice, once assuming slipping and a second time expecting tipping, then compare the actual load to these
      maximums. This process is summarized in the following three steps:

      <title>Failure in Engineering</title>
      <p>The goal of engineering design is to forecast and plan for all the ways that something can fail. The challenge is to know the questions to ask and the data to gather to model all possible failure modes. The controlling failure is the mode which occurs at the smallest load.</p>

        <li>Why is the normal force always perpendicular to the contact surface while the friction force always lies parallel to it?</li>

    <p>A wedge is a tapered object which converts a small input force into a large output force using the principle of an inclined plane.  Wedges are used to separate, split or cut objects, lift weights,  or fix objects in place.  The mechanical advantage of a wedge is determined by the angle of its taper; narrow tapers have a larger mechanical advantge.  </p>
    <p>Wedges are used in two primary ways:</p>
    <p><em> Low friction wedges </em> are a simple machines which allows users to create large output forces to move objects using comparatively small input forces. In the log spltter in <xref ref="log-splitter"/>, hydraulic ram pushes a log into a stationary wedge. The normal force pushes the two halves of the log apart while the friction force <m>F_f</m> is opposes the pushing force <m>P</m>.</p>
    <p><em> High-friction (self-locking) wedges </em> control the location of objects or hold them in place. Examples include doorstop wedges and carpentry wedges. The sailor in <xref ref="shoring-wedges"/> is hammering two wooden wedges towards each other to create large compressive forces to secure shoring timbers during a damage control operation. </p>

    <p>Luckily the analysis of low- and high-friction wedges are identical and they are quite similar to the multi-force body equilibrium problems we saw in <xref ref="Chapter_05"/> and <xref ref="Chapter_06"/>. The main difference is the inclusion of friction from all non-smooth contact surfaces. The directions of both the normal and friction forces on the free-body diagrams are defined below.</p>
    <p><em> Normal forces </em> act between bodies act perpendicular to the contacting surfaces. All normal forces on a free-body diagram should be pointing towards the body because wedges are always subjected to compression.</p>
    <p><em> Friction forces </em> are between bodies which act parallel or tangential to the contacting surfaces and are created by the microscopic or large scale roughness of the surfaces. All friction forces on a free-body diagram should be drawn pointing int the a dirction which resists relative motion at the point of contact.</p>
    <p>The key added challenge of solving wedge problems is that the angled faces of wedges usually need to be resolved into components in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, unless a different coordinate system is used.</p>
    <p> One of the critical steps in solving block or wedge problems is to determine which force is engaging the friction of the system. Start by drawing the friction forces on the body where this force acts . As you pass the friction and normal forces to adjacent free-body diagrams, you must always show them as equal and opposite, action-reaction pairs. This is illustrated in the following example.</p>

    <introduction>
      <p>A screw thread is uniform shape which spirals around the inside or outside surface of a cylinder or cone. Like wedges, screws are simple machines. They are essentially a ramp or inclined plane wrapped into a helix, and the input to screws is torque rather than linear force. The mechanical advantage of a screw depends on its <term>lead</term>, which is the linear distance the screw travels in one revolution. </p>
      <p>Screws used to fix objects in place are called <term>fasteners</term>, and screws used to move objects are called <term>power screws</term> or <term>lead screws</term>. In this chapter we will focus on power screws. </p>
      <p>A power screw assembly includes a nut with matching internal threads which fits around the screw.  There are two ways that a power screw can operate based on the movement of the screw and nut.   In a scissors  jack, the operator rotates the threaded rod with a crank fitted to the nut on the right, which is not threaded but acts as a thrust bearing. The nut on the left moves along the stationary screw to raise the load.  In the C-clamp, the nut is stationary and the screw translates through as it rotates. In either case, a small moment on the screw can cause enormous forces on the nut, with the added benefit of the force being applied at a precise location as controlled by the screw.</p>

      <p>Most screw threads are right-hand threaded, which means they follow a right-hand rule as
        illustrated in <xref ref="screw_rhr"/>. When you use your right hand to then turn a
        right-handed thread towards your
        fingertips, it will move in the direction of your thumb. When you are look at the head of a
        bolt and rotate it clockwise, it tightens <ie/>
        <em> righty-tighty</em>. The reverse, <em>lefty-loosy</em>, is also true.</p>

              <description>Twisting a screw clockwise tightens the screw, which agrees with the right hand rule, i.e. curling fingers of right hand in the direction of the tightening places points the thumb down in the direction the screw moves as tightened.</description>

      <p>Left-handed screws are less common but are found in some applications, especiallly:<ul><li>machines where  reverse-threading prevents them from loosening gradually under the torque of the moving part. For example, the left pedal on a bicycle.</li><li>machines where the movement of the screw creates dual motion, like a hand-screw wood clamp.</li><li>situations where you do not want to mix up constituents. Cutting torches use right-hand thread for the oxygen and left-hand threads for the acetylene connections.</li></ul></p>
      <p>The motion of left-handed screws can either be thought of as opposite the right-hand rule
        or conforming to the same relationships if you use your left hand. Notice that right-handed
        threads slope up to the right, while left-handed threads slope down. Note that turning a
        thread upside-down does not reverse its handedness.</p>

        <p>The focus of this section is to find the magnitude of a moment which will push a screw to impending motion. Impending motion is the threshold between the system holding still and moving, so knowledge of the moment required at impending motion allows you to interpret what happens to the screw system in static but not impending-motion conditions as well.</p>
        <p>Assuming that motion is impending means that we can use the coefficient of static friction <m>\mu_\text{s}</m> and the related friction angle <m>\phi_\text{s}</m>. Recall from earlier in this chapter, that the friction angle <m>\phi_\text{s}</m> is related directly to <m>\mu_\text{s}</m> the by the equation:</p>
        <p>
          <me>\phi_\text{s}=\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{F}{N} \right )</me>

        </p>
        <p>We next need to reduce these two equations to a single equation and also eliminate the difficulty to quantify <m>\Sigma R</m> term. Thus we solve both equations for <m>\Sigma R</m>.</p>

        <p>Then, set them equal to each other and solve for the moment <m>M</m>. <men xml:id="screw_eqn">M=W r \tan(\phi_\text{s}+\alpha)</men>

        <p><m>M</m> is the moment required to raise the screw to impending motion, <m>W</m> is the force load on the screw, <m>r</m> is the mean radius of the screw, <m>\phi_\text{s}</m> is the screw friction angle, and <m>\alpha</m> is the screw thread pitch.</p>
        <p>Practically, this equation sayst hat the moment to move a screw against an applied force

        <title>Applied Force Supports Impending Motion</title>
        <p>When the impending motion of the screw is in the direction of the applied force, we can
          also state that the <q> applied force supports impending motion. </q> This case occurs any time you remove a force held by a screw, like lowering the load supported by the screw jack in <xref ref="screw-jack"/>.  </p>
        <p>This situation is a bit more complicated than the previous one, because there are three
          different possibilities depending on the the relative magnitude of the friction angle
          <m>\phi_\text{s}</m> and the thread angle <m>\alpha</m>. Cases include

        <p>The derivations of the relationships are quite similar to the derivation of <xref ref="screw_eqn"/>, but use subtly different free-body diagrams for each of the three cases. See <xref ref="screw_supports"/> below.</p>

          <title>Self-locking screw</title>
          <p>Self-locking screws are the  type of screws
          that you will encounter most often in mechanical systems as they are highly predictable. They have
          sufficient friction available to hold their applied load even with no moment applied.
          Thus, they can safely carry a load in a static-but-not impending condition until you wish
          to overcome the excess friction by applying a moment <m>M'</m> to push them to impending
          motion.</p>
          <p> Summing the forces in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions for the free-body diagram in <xref ref="self-locking"/> yields:</p>
          <p>
            <men>M’=Wr \tan(\phi_\text{s}-\alpha)</men>
          </p>
        </paragraphs>
        <p><alert>Unwind-with-load screw</alert> As its name implies, an unwind-under-load screw will start turning unless a moment <m>M''</m> is applied to keep the screw at or beyond impending motion. The moment to push a self-locking screw to impending motion <m>M'</m> is in the opposite direction as the moment to keep unwind-under-load screws at impending motion <m>M''</m>, as <m>M''</m> is in the same direction as the moment to loosen (or raise) a screw. These unwind-with-load screws are not often found in mechanical systems, except for in dynamic motion control systems, where the screw is used to slow down motion. </p>
        <p>To be designed in an unwind-with-load condition, a screw must have a quite steep thread angle <m>\alpha</m> and minimal friction between the threads and nut, which reduces <m>\phi_\text{s}</m>.</p>
        <p>Summing the forces in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions for the free-body diagram in
          <xref ref="unwinding"/> yields:</p>
        <p>
          <men>M''=Wr \tan(\alpha-\phi_\text{s})</men>
        </p>
        <p><alert>Impending-motion screw</alert> As the derived equations for all three
          unwind-with-load screw cases push the screw towards impending motion,  when a screw is
          already at impending motion, it requires no applied moment to maintiain equilibium; however, this case is mechanically unstable. If the load increases slightly the screw will begin to unwind-under-load, whereas if the load decreases slightly the screw will become self-locking.</p>
        <p>Summing the forces in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions for the free-body diagram in <xref ref="impending-motion"/> yields:</p>
        <p>
          <men>M'''=0 \text{ when } \phi_\text{s}=\alpha</men>
        </p>
        <p>The concept of an applied force in the direction of impending motion works equally well for either a force applied in the impending motion direction of a screw, or for a force applied to the impending motion direction of a nut.  An example of he first case is the screw jack lowering a load, and the second could be a scissors jack that has a rotating but non-translating screw, plus a non-rotating but translating nut.</p>

      <p>To evaluate flexible belt friction, we start a flat, massless belt passing over a cylindrical surface. If we have an equal tension at each end of the belt, the belt experiences a distributed normal force, which varies as a function of the angle between the contact surface of the belt and the direction the belt tension forces are pulling (<xref ref="belt_MM"/>).</p>
      <p/>

      <p>If there were no friction between the belt and cylinder, if we were to increase the tension on one side of the rope, it would begin to slide across the cylinder. However, if friction is available between the rope and the surface, the friction force will oppose the sliding motion (<xref ref="belt_NN"/>)</p>

      <p>There are two belt shapes discussed in this chapter, flat belts and v-belts (<xref ref="belt_OO"/>). We start with the analysis of flat belts as they are the simpler of the two.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When analyzing systems with belts, we are usually interested in the range of values for the tension forces where the belt does not slip relative to the surface. Starting with the smaller tension force on one side <m>\vec{T}_\text{S}</m> we can increase the second tension force <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> to some maximum value before slipping. For a flat belt, the maximum value for <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> depends on the magnitude of <m>\vec{T}_\text{S}</m> , the static coefficient of friction between the belt and the surface, and the contact angle between the belt and the surface <m>\beta</m> given in radians.</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="finding-contact-angle">
      <title>Finding the Contact Angle <m>\beta</m>
      </title>
      <p>On flexible belt problems, you need to translate the geometry of the incoming angles of each belt into a contact angle <m>\beta</m> between the belt and pulley. The easiest way to do this is to create one or more right triangles using the incoming and outgoing belt paths and work through the various complementary angles to transfer the belt geometry into a contact angle <m>\beta</m> (see example in <xref ref="ggb_fzgfuyex"/>). There is no simplified rule for transferring cable angles over to the contact angle <m>\beta</m> , but in general, extend radial lines from the center of the pulley out to the belt’s tangential lines. Next, create right triangles with each radial line and work to find all the angles which add up to the contact angle <m>\beta</m>.</p>
      <figure xml:id="ggb_fzgfuyex">

      <p>Another challenging step in solving flexible belt friction problems is determining which belt has a larger tension <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> and which has the smaller tension <m>\vec{T}_\text{S}</m>. Unlike guessing the direction of unknown support forces, this is not a decision that you can make incorrectly and later learn of your error with a negative value; hence we will guide you through two ways to make this decision up-front.</p>
      <paragraphs>
        <title>Method 1: Draw free-body diagrams and sum tension along the cable</title>
        <p>Recall that friction always opposes the motion of the body you are evaluating, thus if you can create a free-body diagram of the cable, you can sum forces along the cable. This equation will verify which tension is larger/smaller.</p>

        <title>Method 2: Larger tension is always in the direction of the impending motion of the belt</title>
        <p>Following the logic of Method 1, it turns out that the larger tension <m>T_L</m> is always in the direction of the impending motion of the belt. It does not matter if the belt motion is relative (like in the example for Method 1 above) or absolute, the larger tension is always in the impending motion of the belt. If you are still learning the differences between relative and absolute motion, see the section above.</p>
        <p>There are likely other robust ways to determine the smaller and larger sides of tension in a flexible belt system; make sure you learn a method that works for both potentially moving and also fixed-belt systems.</p>

        <title>Friction in V-belts</title>
        <p>V-belts fit into a groove on a pulley and thereby increases the normal force of contact with the pulley sides (see <xref ref="belt_TT"/> below). This increase in normal force sequentially increases the contact friction. The belt must only contact the sides and not the groove base to maintain this friction advantage.</p>
        <p/>
        <figure xml:id="belt_TT">
          <caption>A V-belt’s <q> enhanced </q> friction comes from the increased normal forces, which are a function of the groove angle <m>\alpha</m>. The sum of the normal force vertical components is the same for a flat belt or V-belt. However, the horizontal components of the normal forces in a V-belt, effectively pinch the belt, thereby increasing the available friction force.</caption>

        <p>As we can see from the equation above, steeper sides to the groove (corresponding to a smaller groove angle <m>\alpha</m> ) result in an increased potential difference in the tension forces. The trade-off with steeper sides, however, is that the belt becomes wedged more firmly in the groove and requires a higher force to unwedge itself as it leaves the pulley. This unwedging force decreases the efficiency of the belt-driven system. An alternate design choice would be a chain-driven system which carries very high-tension differences more efficiently.</p>

        <title>Torque in Belt Systems</title>
        <p>In belt-driven systems, there is usually an input pulley and one (or more) output pulleys. To determine the maximum torque or power that can be transmitted by the belt, we will need to consider each of the pulleys independently, understanding that slipping occurring at either the input or the output will result in a failure of the power transmission.</p>

          </image>
        </figure>
        <p>The first step in determining the maximum moment (or torque) that can be transmitted in the belt drive is to determine the maximum possible value for <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> before slipping occurs at either the input or output pulley. To start this process, we you will need to start by solving for the resting tension. This resting tension is the tension the belts prior to anything moving or power transfer (analogous to the tension in your bike chain when it is at rest). Practically, if you wish to increase or decrease the resting tension, many machines have adjustments to increase or decrease the distance between the pulleys slightly. If we turn on the machine and increase the moments on both pulleys, the resting tension <m>\vec{T}_\text{S}</m> remains constant while the tension on the drive side <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> increases.</p>
        <p>If the pulleys are the same material (and therefore the same coefficients of friction), it can be assumed that the belt will first slip at the smaller of the two pulleys as the smaller pulley has a smaller contact angle <m>\beta</m>.</p>
        <p>Once we have the maximum value for <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> , we can use that to find the maximum input and output moments. Next, to find the torque, we then find the net moment exerted by the two tension forces, where the radius of the pulley is the moment arm.</p>
        <p>The maximum input torque <m>M_i</m> before slipping is</p>
        <p>
          <me>M_\text{i} = (T_\text{Lmax}-T_\text{S})r_\text{input}</me>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>The maximum output torque M_o before slipping is</p>
        <p>
          <me>M_\text{o} = (T_\text{Lmax}-T_\text{S})r_\text{output}</me>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>To find the maximum power we can transfer with the belt drive system, we will use the rotational definition of power, where the power is equal to the torque times the angular velocity in radians per second. Unlike the torque, the power at the input and the output will be the same, assuming no inefficiencies.<men>P_\text{max} = M_\text{i} (\omega_\text{input}) = M_\text{o} (\omega_\text{output})</men></p>

      <title>Journal Bearing Friction</title>
      <p>A bearing is a machine element used to support a rotating shaft. Bearing friction is the friction that exists between the rotating shaft and the supporting bearing. Though many types of bearings exist (journal, ball, roller, hydrodynamic), in this course, we only focus on dry friction journal bearings. Most bearings are lubricated and thus require knowledge of fluids to analyze, but dry friction journal bearings have a single contact point between the shaft and bearing (as shown in <xref ref="journal_XX"/> below). While the single contact point makes them solvable in statics, the single contact point would be subject to wear and heat build-up if used for long-duration motion; thus, the use of journal bearings is only advisable in situations where there is limited motion.</p>

      <title>Journal Bearings with a Rotating Shaft and a Fixed Bearing</title>
      <p>A journal bearing consists of a circular shaft fitted into a slightly larger circular bearing, as shown in <xref ref="journal_XX"/>. The application of a standard journal bearing includes a rotating shaft, which is also exerting a load <m>F_\text{load}</m> onto the bearing. The friction force and shaft rotation cause the shaft to climb up the side of the bearing.</p>
      <p/>
      <figure xml:id="journal_XX">
        <caption>(left) In a journal bearing like the one shown here with a vertical force applied to the shaft, the contact point is located along the line of action of the applied force. (middle) If a CW couple-moment <m>M_\text{CW}</m> attempts to rotate the shaft, then the contact point will move to the right as the friction force between the shaft and bearing causes the surfaces to stick, and the shaft climbs up the bearing until impending motion is reached. (right) If a CCW couple-moment <m>M_\text{CCW}</m> is applied, then the contact point will shift to the left as the friction force between the shaft and bearing causes the surfaces to stick, and the shaft climbs up the bearing until impending motion is reached.</caption>

      <p>Now that you have learned the underlying physical interaction between a shaft and journal bearing, let us transition to the forces which support this interaction. If we create free-body diagrams for the shaft in all three cases presented in <xref ref="journal_XX"/> above, we see a combination of a normal force <m>\vec{N}</m> and a friction force <m>\vec{F}</m> at each contact point (in <xref ref="journal_YY"/> below).</p>

        <caption>The shafts in the three journal bearings above can be turned into free-body diagrams by replacing the bearing and contact point with the forces which act through the contact point. Note in all three cases the normal force <m>\vec{N}</m> perpendicular to the tangential line of contact, which makes its line of action a radial line through the center of each shaft. Additionally, (left) there is no friction engaged, (middle) the friction resists the CW moment, and (left) the friction resists the CCW moment. The friction circle (radius <m>r_f</m> ) is explained in the steps below.</caption>

      <p>The most straightforward process to accurately relate the normal and friction forces for a journal bearing is by performing the following steps:<ol><li>First, assume for measured distances that the shaft and bearing opening have the same radius, but always draw the shaft a bit smaller so you can see its contact point with the bearing.

        <p>If you are still struggling to determine the direction of the contact point shift, try this rule:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The contact point always shifts in the direction of the impending motion of the bearing.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The impending motion can be absolute (in the case of a fixed shaft and rotating bearing) or relative (in the case of a fixed bearing). Remember, the relative motion of the bearing is always opposite the absolute impending motion of the shaft.</p>

      <p>To start our analysis of disk friction we will use the example of a collar bearing, which has a hollow circular contact area between the rotating collar and the stationary surface (<xref ref="disk_QQ"/>). In this type of bearing, we will have a rotating shaft traveling through a hole in a surface. The shaft is supporting some load force as shown and a collar is used to support the shaft itself.</p>

      <p>The friction force at any point in the contact area will be equal to the normal force at that point times the kinetic coefficient of friction at that point. If we assume a uniform pressure between the collar and the surface and a uniform coefficient of friction, then we will have the same friction force exerted at all points. This does not translate however into an equal moment exerted by each point. Points further from the center of rotation will exert a larger moment than points closer to the center of rotation because they will have a larger moment arm.</p>
      <figure xml:id="disk_RR">
        <caption>The friction forces on any differential element are assumed to be the same (due to a uniformly distributed normal force), yet elements along the outside edge of the contact area will cause a larger moment than those in the inside edge due to a greater radius.</caption>

      <p/>
      <p>To determine the total moment exerted by the friction forces, we will need to integrate the friction from all elements of the contact area. The moment of each element ( <m>dM</m> ) will be equal to the product of the kinetic coefficient of friction ( <m>\mu_k</m> ), the normal force pressure ( <m>p</m> ), the distance from that point to the center of rotation ( <m>r</m> ), and the area of each element ( <m>dA</m> ).<me>dM=\mu_k p r\; dA</me></p>
      <p>The total friction moment can be found by integrating the moment of each element over the contact area:<me>M=\int_A dM=\int_A \mu_k p r \; dA</me></p>
      <p/>
      <p>To simplify the equation we can move the constant coefficient of friction and the constant normal force pressure term outside of the integral. We can also replace the pressure term with the applied force on the bearing over the contact area. Finally, so that we can integrate over the range of <m>R</m> values, we can recognize that the rate of change in the area ( <m>dA</m> ) for the hollow circular areas is simply the rate of change of the <m>r\;dr</m> term multiplied by the circumference of the circle at <m>r</m>. These changes lead to the equation below.<me>M=\mu_k\left ( \frac{F}{\pi(r_\text{o}^{2}-r_\text{i}^{2})} \right )\int_{r_\text{i}}^{r_\text{o} }r\; (2\pi r)\;dr</me></p>
      <p/>
      <p>Finally, we can evaluate the integral from the inner radius to the outer radius. If we evaluate the integral and simplify we will end up with the final equation below.<men>M=\frac{2}{3} \mu_k F\left ( \frac{r_\text{o}^{3}-r_\text{i}^{3}}{r_\text{o}^{2}-r_\text{i}^{2}} \right )</men></p>
