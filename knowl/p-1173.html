<div class="para">You may be wondering what is the point of including a member in a truss if it supports no load. In our simplified example problems, they really are unnecessary, but in the real world, zero-force members are important for several reasons:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">We have assumed that all members have negligible weight or if not, applied half the weight to each pin. The <em class="emphasis">actual</em> weight of <em class="emphasis">real</em> members invalidates the two-force body assumption and leads to errors. Consider a vertical member -- the internal forces must at least support the member’s weight.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Truss members are not actually rigid, and long slender members under compression will <em class="emphasis">buckle</em> and collapse. The so-called zero-force member will be engaged to prevent this buckling. In the previous example, members CD and DE are under compression and form an unstable equilibrium and would definitely buckle at pin <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> if they were not replaced with a single member <span class="process-math">\(CE\)</span> with sufficient rigidity.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Trusses are often used over a wide array of loading conditions. While a member may be zero-force for one loading condition, it will likely be engaged under a different condition — think about how the load on a bridge shifts as a heavy truck drives across.</div></li>
