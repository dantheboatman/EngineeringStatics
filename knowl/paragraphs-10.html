You can swap out two or more components and replace them with a single equivalent resultant force.</div> <div class="para">Any number of <em class="emphasis">concurrent</em> forces can be added together to produce a single resultant force. By definition, the lines of action of concurrent forces all intersect at a common point. The resultant must be placed at this intersection point in order for this replacement to be equivalent. This is because before and after the replacement, the moment about the intersection point is zero. If the resultant was placed somewhere else, that would not be true.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="equivalent-tranformations.html#paragraphs-10" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
