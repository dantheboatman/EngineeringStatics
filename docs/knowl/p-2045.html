<div class="para">We have seen that when there is friction between a belt and a pulley, the tensions on either end of the belt are not the same. In previous problems, we simply guessed a direction for an unknown force, and then used the sign of the numerical answer to confirm or reverse our assumption. Unfortunately, this does not work for flexible belts, where we must make the correct determination before starting computations. So, how can we determine which side has the larger tension, and which side is smaller?</div>
