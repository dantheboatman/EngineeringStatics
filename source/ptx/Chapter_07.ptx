  <title>Centroids and Centers of Gravity</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
			A <term>centroid</term> is the geometric center of a geometric object: a one-dimensional curve, a two-dimensional area or a three-dimensional volume.
			Centroids are useful for many situations in Statics and subsequent courses, including the analysis of distributed forces, beam bending, and shaft torsion.
		</p>
    <p>
			Two related concepts are the <term>center of gravity</term>, which is the average location of an object's <em>weight</em>, and the <term>center of mass</term> which is the average location of an object's <em>mass</em>.
			In many engineering situations, the centroid, center of mass, and center of gravity are all coincident.
			Because of this, these three terms are often used interchangeably without regard to their precise meanings.
		</p>
    <p>
      We consciously and subconsciously use centroids for many things in life and engineering, including:
      <ul marker="">
        <li><em>Keeping your body's balance:</em> Try standing up with your feet together and leaning your head and hips in front of your feet.
					You have just moved your body's center of gravity out of line with the support of your feet.
				</li>
        <li><em>Computing the stability of objects in motion like cars, airplanes, and boats:</em> By understanding how the center of gravity interacts with the accelerations caused by motion, we can compute safe speeds for sharp curves on a highway.
				</li>
        <li><em>Designing the structural support to balance the structure's own weight and applied loadings on buildings, bridges, and dams:</em> We design most large infrastructure not to move.
					To keep it from moving, we must understand how the structure's weight, people, vehicles, wind, earth pressure, and water pressure balance with the structural supports.
				</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
			You probably have already developed a good intuition about centroids and centers of gravity based upon your life experience, and can roughly estimate their location when you look at an object or diagram.
			In this chapter you will learn to locate them precisely using two techniques: <xref ref="centroids-by-integration">integration</xref> and the method of <xref ref="composite-parts"> composite parts</xref>.

  <section xml:id="weghted-average">
    <title>Weighted Averages</title>
    <p>
			You certainly know how to find the average of several numbers by adding them up and dividing by the number of values, so for example the average of the first four positive integers is
			<me>
				\frac{1+2+3+4}{4} = 2.5
			</me></p>
    <p>
			More formally, if <m>a</m> is a set with <m>n</m> elements then the average, or <alert>mean,</alert> value is
			<men>
				\bar{a} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n}{n}
			</men>.
			This average is also called the <term>arithmetic mean</term>.
			When calculating an arithmetic mean, each number is equally important when evaluating the average.
			The overbar symbol is often used to indicate that a quantity is a mean value.
		</p>
    <p>
			In situations where some values are more important than others, we use a <term>weighted average</term>.
			A familiar example is your grade point average.
			Your GPA is calculated by weighting your grade for each class by the credits for that class, then dividing by the total credits you have taken.
			The credit values are called the <term>weighting factors</term>.
		</p>
    <p>
			In general terms a weighted average is
			<men xml:id="weighted-average">\bar{a} = \frac{\sum a_i w_i}{\sum {w_i}}
			</men>
			Where <m>a_i</m> are the values we are averaging and <m>w_i</m> are the corresponding weighting factors.
			The weighting factors may be different for each item being averaged, so <m>w_i</m> is the weighting factor for value <m>a_i</m>.
			In this book we will not write the limits on the sums, and understand that the intent is always to sum over all the values.
			Notice that if the weighting factors are all identical, they can be factored out of the sums so the weighted average and the arithmetic mean will be the same.
		</p>
    <p>
			Weighted averaging is used to find centroids, centers of gravity and centers of mass, the subject of this chapter.
			All three are <em>points</em> located at the <q>center</q> the object, but the meaning of <q>center</q> depends on the weighting factors.
			Area or volume are the factors used for centroids, weight for center of gravity, and mass for center of mass.

    <title>Center of Gravity</title>

			So far in this book we have always taken the weight of an object to act at a point at its center.
			This is the <term>center of gravity</term>: the point where all of an object's weight may be concentrated and still have the same <em>external</em> effect on the body.
			In this chapter we will learn to actually locate this point.

				We will indicate the center of gravity with a circle with black and white quadrants, and call its coordinates <m>(\bar{x}, \bar{y})</m> or <m>(\bar{x}, \bar{y}, \bar{z})</m>.
				This point represents the average location of all the particles which make up the body.

      <p>
				The center of gravity of a body is fixed with respect to the body, but the coordinates depend on the choice of coordinate system.
				For example, in <xref ref="centroid_def"/> the center of gravity of the block is at its geometric center meaning that <m>\bar{x}</m> and <m>\bar{y}</m> are positive, but if the block is moved to the left of the <m>y</m> axis, or the coordinate system is translated to the right of the block, <m>\bar{x}</m> would then become negative.

			Lets explore the center of gravity of a familiar object.
			Take a pencil and try to balance it on your finger.
			How do you decide where to place it? You likely supported it roughly in the middle, then adjusted it until it balanced.
			You found the point where the moments of the weights on either side of your finger were in equilibrium.
		</p>
    <p>
			Let's develop this balanced moment idea mathematically.
		</p>
    <p>
			Assume that the two halves of the pencil have known weights acting at points 1 and 2.
			How could we replace the two weights with a single statically equivalent force? Recall from <xref ref="statically-equivalent-systems"/> that statically equivalent systems produce the same external effect on the object <mdash/>the net force on the object, and the net moment about any point don't change.
			An upward force at this point will support the pencil without tipping.
		</p>
    <p>
			To be equivalent, the total weight must equal the total weight of the parts.
			<m>W = W_1 + W_2</m>.
			Common sense also tells us that <m>W</m> will act somewhere between <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m>.

			Next, let's do the mathematical equivalent of sliding your finger back and forth until a balance point is located.
			Pick any point <m>O</m> to be the origin, then calculate the total moment about <m>O</m> due to the two weights.
		</p>
    <p>
			The sum of moments around point <m>O</m> can be written as:
		</p>
    <p><me>
				\sum M_O=-x_1 W_1 -x_2 W_2
			</me></p>
    <p>
			Notice that the moment of both forces are clockwise around point <m>O</m>, so the signs are negative according to the right-hand rule.
			We want a single equivalent force acting at the (unknown) center of gravity.
			Call the distance from the origin to the center of gravity <m>\bar{x}</m>.
		</p>
    <p><m>\bar{x}</m> represents the mean distance of the weight, mass, or area depending on the context of the problem.
			We are evaluating weights in this problem, so <m>\bar{x}</m> represents the distance from <m>O</m> to the center of gravity.
		</p>
    <p>
			The sum of moments around point <m>O</m> for the equivalent system can be written as:
			<me>
				\sum M_O=-\bar{x} W
			</me></p>
    <p>
      The moment of total weight <m>W</m> is also clockwise around point <m>O</m>, so the sign of moment will also be negative according to the right-hand rule.
			Since the two representation are equivalent we can equate them and solve for <m>\bar{x}</m>.

			This result is exactly in the form of <xref ref="weighted-average"/> where the value being averaged is distance <m>x</m> and the weighting factor is the weight of part <m>W_i</m> and the result is the mean distance <m>\bar{x}</m>.
		</p>
    <p>
      The pencil was made up of two halves, but this equation can easily be extended <m>n</m> discrete parts.
			The resulting general definition of the centroidal coordinate <m>\bar{x}</m> is:
			<men>
				\bar{x}=\frac{\sum \bar{x}_{i} W_i}{\sum W_i}

        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
			The numerator is the <term>first moment</term> of force which is literally a moment of force as we defined it in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/>.
			The denominator is the sum of the weights of the pieces, which is the weight of the whole object.
			We will soon also see first moments of mass and first moments of area and in <xref ref="Chapter_10"/>, we will introduce <term>second moments</term>, which are the integral of some quantity like area, multiplied by a distance <em>squared</em>.
		</p>
    <p>
			We treated the pencil as a one-dimensional object, so this discussion focused on <m>\bar{x}</m>.
			There are similar formula for the other dimensions as well

			<me>
				\text{distance to CG}=\frac{\text{sum of first moments of weight}}{\text{total weight}}

					Can you explain why the center of gravity of a symmetrical object will always fall on the axis of symmetry?

      <answer>
        <p>
					If the object is symmetrical, every subpart on the positive side of the axis of symmetry will be balanced by an identical part on the negative side.
					The first moment for the entire shape about the axis will sum to zero, meaning that
					<me>
						\bar{x} = \frac{\sum \bar{x}_{i} W_i}{\sum W_i} = \frac{0}{W} = 0

					In other words, the distance from the axis of symmetry of the shape to the centroid is zero.

    <introduction>
      <p>
				A centroid is a weighted average like the center of gravity, but weighted with a geometric property like area or volume, and not a physical property like weight or mass.
				This means that centroids are properties of pure shapes, not physical objects.
				They represent the coordinates of the <q>middle</q> of the shape.
			</p>
      <p>
				The defining equations for centroids are similar to the equations for <xref ref="center_of_gravity">Centers of Gravity</xref> but with <em>volume</em> used as the weighting factor for three-dimensional shapes
				<men xml:id="three-d-centroid"> \bar{x}=\frac{\sum \bar{x}_{i} V_i}{\sum V_i} \quad \bar{y}=\frac{\sum \bar{y}_{i} V_i}{\sum V_i} \quad \bar{z}=\frac{\sum \bar{z}_{i} V_i}{\sum V_i}
				</men>,
				and <em>area</em> for two-dimensional shapes
				<men xml:id="two-d-centroid"> \bar{x}=\frac{\sum \bar{x}_{i} A_i}{\sum A_i} \quad \bar{y}=\frac{\sum \bar{y}_{i} A_i}{\sum A_i}
				</men>.
			</p>
      <p>
				We will see how to use these equations on complex shapes later in this chapter, but centroids of some simple shapes can be easily found using symmetry.
			</p>
      <p>
				If the shape has an axis of symmetry, every point on one side of the axis is mirrored by another point equidistant on the other side.
				One has a positive distance from the axis, and the other is the same distance away in the negative direction.
				These two points will add to zero the numerator, as will every other point making up the shape, and the first moment will be zero.
				This means that the centroid must lie along the line of symmetry if there is one.
				If a shape has multiple symmetry lines, then the centroid must exist at their intersection.

				In this section we will discuss how to find centroids of two-dimensional shapes by first dividing them into pieces with known properties, and then combining the pieces to find the centroid of the original shape.
				This method will work when the geometric properties of all the sub-shapes are known or can be easily determined.
				If the shape can't be decomposed this way, perhaps because it has a curved boundary, you will need to use integration to find the centroid.
				Integration will be covered in <xref ref="centroids-by-integration"/>.

				For more complex shapes, the usual practice is to set up a table to organize the information needed to calculate the centroid, as we will now show.
				The process can be broken into three steps.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>Break the overall shape into simpler parts</title>
            <p>
							We begin with a sketch of the shape and establish a coordinate system.
							It is critical that all measurements are made from a common origin, and the results will be measured from this origin as well.
							A careful choice of origin can simplify the problem, so give it some thought.
						</p>
            <p>
							Then divide the shape into several simpler shapes.
							The sub-shapes may include holes, which are treated as negative areas.
							You must know how to calculate the area and locate the centroid of any sub-shape you use.
						</p>
            <p>
							Consider the complex shape below.
						</p>
            <image source="images/composite-ex-0" width="50%">
              <shortdescription>A rectangle has its bottom left corner at the origin, and top right at (5, 4).
							The left side of a right triangle of height 4 cm and width 6 cm is flush with the right side of the rectangle.
							A circle of r = 1.5 cm is cut out of the rectangle, with it's center at (3, 2).</shortdescription>
            </image>
            <p>
							There are often several ways to divide a shape, but it's best to use as few parts as possible to minimize your computations and opportunities for error.
							For example, you could choose to break this shape into either a <m>\cm{5} \times \cm{4}</m> rectangle, a <m>\cm{6} \times \cm{4}</m> right triangle, and an <m>r = \cm{1.5}</m> circular hole,
						</p>
            <image source="images/composite-ex-1" width="70%">
              <shortdescription>Rectangle plus triangle minus circle</shortdescription>
            </image>
            <p>
							or a large <m>\cm{11} \times \cm{4}</m> rectangle, an <m>r = \cm{1.5}</m> circular hole, and a <m>\cm{6} \times \cm{4}</m> right triangle subtracted from the large rectangle.
						</p>
            <image source="images/composite-ex-2" width="70%">
              <shortdescription>Rectangle of width 11 cm and height 4 cm minus right triangle with vertices at (5,4) and (11,0) minus circle.</shortdescription>
            </image>
            <p>
							Both options will give the same results, and in this case there is no particular advantage to one choice over the other.
							However, it would be silly and unnecessary to break this into more than three parts, and it would not be a good idea to divide this into a trapezoid minus a hole, unless you know geometric properties of a trapezoid, which are not available in <xref ref="centroid-table"/>.
							Be sure your sub-shapes don't overlap and don't get counted more than once.

            <title>Collect the areas and centroid coordinates</title>
            <p>
							Once the complex shape has been divided into parts, the next step is to determine the area and centroidal coordinates for each part.
							You can use the properties in <xref ref="centroid-table"/> for rectangles, triangles, circles, semi-circles and quarter circles but you will need to use integration if other shapes are involved.
							Any holes or removed shapes should be treated as negative areas.
						</p>
            <p>
							Record the information you gather in a table like the one below.
							The table should include a row containing column headings and units, one row for each part, and a summary row.

        The centroid of a three-dimensional volume is found similarly to two-dimensional centroids, but with volume used instead of area for the weighting factor.

				Many three-dimensional shapes are just prismatic extrusions of the shapes.
				The volume of a prism is the product of the cross-sectional area and the length of the prism and is easily calculated.
				For example, the volume of a circular cylinder with radius <m>r</m> and length <m>l</m> is <m>V=\pi\ r^2\ l</m>.

        If the density varies for each part of a composite solid, we can find the center of mass by dividing the first moment of mass by the total mass.

    <p>
			The weighted average technique discussed in <xref ref="weighted-average"/> are a fine for averaging several discrete values, but what do we do if we need to find the average of an infinite number of values or values which change continuously?
		</p>
    <p>
			Consider a function <m>y=f(x)</m> over some interval from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.
			How can we find the average value <m>\bar{y}</m> of the function over that interval? To understand what is meant by the average value of a function, look at the interactive below.
			There, the function <m>f(x)</m> is the red curve, and which you can change if you like.
			The blue dots <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> mark the beginning and end of the interval and are also adjustable.
		</p>
    <p>
			The area under this curve between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> is shaded with gray, and we can find it using a definite integral
			<me>
				\int_a^b f(x)\ dx
			</me>
			The blue hatched rectangle has the same area as the gray shaded region, and because the areas are the same, the height of the rectangle <m>\bar{y}</m>, is the average value of <m>f(x)</m>.

			<m>f(x)</m> is the value being averaged and the weighting function is <m>dx</m>.
		</p>
    <p>
      This approach is true for any choice of weighting function.
			To find <m>\bar{x}</m> for a two dimensional area, the value to be averaged is <m>x</m> and the weighting function is <m>dA</m>, so replacing <m>dx</m> with <m>dA</m> and <m>x_i</m> with <m>x</m>,
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \bar{x}\amp = \frac{\sum \bar{x}_{i} A_i}{\sum A_i} \amp \amp \Rightarrow \amp \bar{x}\amp = \frac{\int x dA}{\int dA}

      In other words, to transform a discrete summation to an equivalent continuous integral form you:

						Replace the summation with integration, <m>\Sigma \Rightarrow \smallint</m>.
					</p>

        <li>
          <p>
						Replace the discrete weighting factor with the corresponding differential element,

						</me></p>
        </li>
        <li>

						Rename the value being averaged to eliminate the index <m>i</m>.

        <p>
					Siri says that <q> The average distance from the earth to the sun is 92,958,412 miles.</q></p>
        <p>
					That's a pretty exact answer.
					What does it mean, exactly? From what point on the earth to what point on the sun?
				</p>
        <p>
					If the earth and sun were perfect spheres, we could use the distance between their centroids.
					With more information about shape and density, we could find their centers of mass and measure between those points.
				</p>
        <p>
					The bigger problem is that this distance changes continuously as the earth revolves around the sun.
					How can we find an average value for something which is continuously changing?
				</p>
        <p>
					We need to use the methods described here, integrating the distance as a function of time over the course of a year.

        ,
				where
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><m>dA</m> is a differential bit of area called the <em>element</em>.
						</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><m>A</m> is the <em>total area</em> enclosed by the shape, and is found by evaluating the first integral.

          <li>
            <p><m>\bar{x}_{\text{el}}</m> and <m>\bar{y}_{\text{el}}</m> are the coordinates of the <em>centroid of the element</em>.
							These are frequently functions of <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>, not constant values.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p><m>Q_x</m> and <m>Q_y</m> are the <term/><em>First moments of Area</em> with respect to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axis.
						</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The procedure for finding centroids with integration can be broken into three steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>Set up the integrals</title>
            <p>
							Usually this is the hardest step.
						</p>
            <p>
							You should always begin by drawing a sketch of the problem and reviewing the given information.
						</p>
            <p>
							You will need to understand the boundaries of the shape, which may be lines or functions.
							You may need to know some math facts, like the definition of slope, or the equation of a line or parabola.
							A bounding function may be given as a function of <m>x</m>, but you want it as a function of <m>y,</m> or vice-versa or it may have a constant which you will need to determine.
						</p>
            <p>
							You will need to choose an element of area <m>dA</m>.
							There are several choices available, including vertical strips, horizontal strips, or square elements; or in polar coordinates, rings, wedges or squares.
							There really is no right or wrong choice; they will all work, but one may make the integration easier than another.
							The best choice depends on the nature of the problem, and it takes some experience to predict which it

              The two most common choices for differential elements are:

                <li>
                  <title>Square elements and double integrals</title>
                  <p>
										If you choose an infinitesimal square element <m>dA = dx\;dy</m>, you must integrate twice, over <m>x</m> and over <m>y</m> between the appropriate integration limits.
										The position of the element typically designated <m>(x,y)</m>.
									</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <title>Rectangular elements and single integrals</title>
                  <p>
										If you choose rectangular strips you eliminate the need to integrate twice.
										You may select a vertical element with a different width <m>dx</m>, and a height extending from the lower to the upper bound, or a horizontal strip with a differential height <m>dy</m> and a width extending from the left to the right boundaries.
										Either way, you only integrate once to cover the enclosed area.
									</p>
                  <p>
										When finding the area enclosed by a single function <m>y=f(x)</m>, and the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes <m>(x,y)</m> represents a point on the function and <m>dA = y\ dx</m> for vertical strips, or <m>dA = x\ dy</m> for horizontal strips.
									</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
							You must find expressions for the area <m>dA</m> and centroid of the element <m>(\bar{x}_{\text{el}}, \bar{y}_{\text{el}})</m> in terms of the bounding functions.
							This is how we turn an integral over an area into a definite integral which can be integrated.
						</p>
            <p>
							When you have established all these items, you can substitute them into <xref ref="centroid_eqn"/> and proceed to the integration step.

          <li>
            <title>Solve the integrals</title>
            <p>
							This step is pure mathematics.
						</p>
            <p>
							Here are some tips if you are doing integration <q>by hand</q>.
							Be neat, work carefully, and check your work as you go along.
							Use proper mathematics notation: don't lose the differential <m>dx</m> or <m>dy</m> before the integration step, and don't include it afterwords.
							Don't forget to use equals signs between steps.
							Simplify as you go and don't substitute numbers or other constants too soon.
							Pay attention to units: Area <m>A</m> should have units of <m>[\textrm{length}]^2</m> and the first moments of area <m>Q_x</m> and <m>Q_y</m> should have units of <m>[\textrm{length}]^3</m>.
							If your units aren't consistent, then you have made a mistake.

            <title>Evaluate the centroid</title>
            <p>
              After you have evaluated the integrals you will have expressions or values for <m>A</m>, <m>Q_x</m>, and <m>Q_y</m>.
							All that remains is to substitute these into the defining equations for <m>\bar{x}</m> and <m>\bar{y}</m> and simplify.
							Notice the <m>Q_x</m> goes into the <m>\bar{y}</m> equation, and vice-versa.

        <title>What is <m>dA</m>?</title>
        <p><m>dA</m> is just an area, but an extremely tiny one!
				</p>
        <p>
					It's an example of an <term>differential quantity</term><mdash/><term/>also called an <term>infinitesimal</term>.
					A differential quantity is a value which is as close to zero as it can possibly be without actually being zero.
					You can think of its value as <m>\frac{1}{\infty}</m>.
					Integration is the process of adding up an infinite number of infinitesimal quantities.
				</p>
        <p>
					Some other differential quantities we will see in statics are <m>dx</m>, <m>dy</m> and <m>dz</m>, which are infinitesimal increments of distance; <m>dV</m>, which is a differential volume; <m>dW</m>, a differential weight; <m>dm</m>, a differential mass, and so on.
				</p>
        <p>
					Any product involving a differential quantity is itself a differential quantity, so if the area of a vertical strip is given by <m>dA =y\ dx</m> then, even though height <m>y</m> is a real number, the area is a differential because <m>dx</m> is differential.
				</p>
        <p>
					If you like, you can pronounce the <m>d</m> as <q>the little bit of</q> so <m>dA = y\ dx</m> reads <q>The little bit of area is the height <m>y</m> times a little bit of <m>x</m>.</q> and <m>A = \int dA</m> reads <q>The total area is the sum of the little bits of area.</q></p>

      <p>
        In this section we will use the integration process describe above to calculate the area of the general spandrel shown in <xref ref="general-spandrel-ggb"/>.
				A <term>spandrel</term> is the area between a curve and a rectangular frame.
				This is a general spandrel because the curve is defined by the function <m>y = k x^n</m>, where <m>n</m> is not specified.
				If <m>n = 0</m> the function is constant, if <m>n=1</m> then it is a straight line, <m>n=2</m> it's a parabola,
        <etc/>
        .
				You can change the slider to see the effect of different values of <m>n</m>.

        Begin by identifying the bounding functions.
				From the diagram, we see that the boundaries are the function, the <m>x</m> axis and, the vertical line <m>x = b</m>.
				The function <m>y=kx^n</m> has a constant <m>k</m> which has not been specified, but which is not arbitrary.
				The diagram indicates that the function passes through the origin and point <m>(a,b)</m>, and there is only one value of <m>k</m> which will cause this.
				We can find <m>k</m> by substituting <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> into the function for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> then solving for it.

      </p>
      <p>
				Next, choose a differential area.
				For this problem a vertical strip works well.
				A vertical strip has a width <m>dx</m>, and extends from the bottom boundary to the top boundary.
				Any point on the curve is <m>(x,y)</m> and a point directly below it on the <m>x</m> axis is <m>(x,0)</m>.
				This means that the height of the strip is <m>(y-0) = y</m> and the area of the strip is (base <m>\times</m> height), so
				<me>
					dA =y\ dx
				</me>.
			</p>
      <p>
				The limits on the integral are from <m>x=0</m> on the left to <m>x=a</m> on the right since we are integrating with respect to <m>x</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
        With these details established, the next step is to set up and evaluate the integral <m>A = \int dA = \int_0^a y\ dx</m>.
				This is the familiar formula from calculus for the area under a curve.
				Proceeding with the integration

          </mrow>

      </p>
      <p>
				This result is not a number, but a general formula for the area under a curve in terms of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>n</m>.
				Explore with the interactive, and notice for instance that when <m>n=0</m>, the shape is a rectangle and <m>A = ab</m>; when <m>n=1</m> the shape is a triangle and the <m>A = ab/2</m>; when <m>n=2</m> the shape is a parabola and <m>A = ab/3</m> etc.
				This single formula gives the equation for the area under a whole family of curves.

					The interactive below compares horizontal and vertical strips for a shape bounded by the parabola <m>y^2 = x</m> and the diagonal line <m>y = x-2</m>.
					Horizontal strips are a better choice in this case, because the left and right boundaries are easy to express as functions of <m>y</m>.
					If vertical strips are chosen, the parabola must be expressed as two different functions of <m>x</m>, and two integrals are needed to cover the area, the first from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=1</m>, and the second from <m>x=1</m> to <m>x=4</m>.

      <p>
				This section contains several examples of finding centroids by integration, starting with very simple shapes and getting progressively more difficult.
				All the examples include interactive diagrams to help you visualize the integration process, and to see how <m>dA</m> is related to <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
				The first two examples are a rectangle and a triangle evaluated three different ways: with vertical strips, horizontal strips, and using double integration.
				The different approaches produce identical results, as you would expect.
				You should try to decide which method is easiest for a particular situation.

									With double integration, you must take care to evaluate the limits correctly, since the limits on the inside integral are functions of the variable of integration of the outside integral.

									Determining the bounding functions and setting up the integrals is usually the most difficult part of problems like this.
									Begin by drawing and labeling a sketch of the situation.
								</p>

                    <li>
											Place a point in the first quadrant and label it <m>P=(a,b)</m>.
											This point is in the first quadrant and fixed since we are told that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are positive integers
										</li>
                    <li>
											Place a horizontal line through <m>P</m> to make the upper bound.
										</li>
                    <li>
											Sketch in a parabola with a vertex at the origin and passing through <m>P</m> and shade in the enclosed area.
										</li>
                    <li>
											Decide which differential element you intend to use.
											For this example we choose to use vertical strips, which you can see if you tick <c>show strips</c> in the interactive above.
											Horizontal strips <m>dA = x\ dy</m> would give the same result, but you would need to define the equation for the parabola in terms of <m>y</m>.

                </p>
                <p>
									Determining the equation of the parabola and expressing it in terms of <m>x</m> and any known constants is a critical step.
									You should remember from algebra that the general equation of parabola with a vertex at the origin is <m>y = k x^2</m>, where <m>k</m> is a constant which determines the shape of the parabola.
									If <m>k \gt 0</m>, the parabola opens upward and if <m>k \lt 0</m>, the parabola opens downward.
								</p>
                <p>
                  To find the value of <m>k</m>, substitute the coordinates of <m>P</m> into the general equation, then solve for <m>k</m>.

						We will use <xref ref="centroid_eqn"/> with polar coordinates <m>(\rho, \theta)</m> to solve this problem because they are a natural fit for the geometry.
						In polar coordinates, the equation for the bounding semicircle is simply

						Normally this involves evaluating three integrals but as you will see, we can take some shortcuts in this problem.
						Otherwise we will follow the same procedure as before.

    <introduction>
      <p><term>Distributed loads</term> are forces which are spread out over a length, area, or volume.
				Most real-world loads are distributed, including the weight of building materials and the force of wind, water, or earth pushing on a surface.
				Pressure, load, weight density and stress are all names commonly used for distributed loads.
				Distributed load is a force per unit length or force per unit area depicted with a series of force vectors joined together at the top, and will be designated as <m>w(x)</m> to indicate that the distributed loading is a function of <m>x</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
        For example, although a shelf of books <em>could</em> be treated as a collection of individual forces, it is more common and convenient to represent the weight of the books as a <term>uniformly distributed load</term>.
				A uniformly distributed load is a load which has the same value everywhere,
        <ie/><m>w(x) = C</m>, a constant.

				We can use the computational tools discussed in the previous chapters to handle distributed loads if we first convert them to equivalent point forces.
				This equivalent replacement must be the <term>resultant</term> of the distributed loading, as discussed in <xref ref="statically-equivalent-systems"/>.
				Recall that this resultant force has the same external effect on the object as the original system of forces did.
			</p>
      <p>
        To be equivalent, the point force must have a:
        <ul>
          <li>
						Magnitude equal to the area or volume under the distributed load function.
					</li>
          <li>
						Line of action that passes through the centroid of the distributed load distribution.
					</li>
        </ul>

				The next two sections will explore how to find the magnitude and location of the equivalent point force for a distributed load.

      <title>Equivalent Location</title>
      <p>
				To use a distributed load in an equilibrium problem, you must know the equivalent magnitude to sum the forces, and also know the position or line of action to sum the moments.
			</p>
      <p>
				The line of action of the equivalent force acts through the centroid of area under the load intensity curve.
				For a rectangular loading, the centroid is in the center.
				We know the vertical and horizontal coordinates of this centroid, but since the equivalent point force's line of action is vertical and we can slide a force along its line of action, the vertical coordinate of the centroid is not important in this context.
			</p>
      <p>
				Similarly, for a triangular distributed load <mdash/> also called a <term>uniformly varying load</term><mdash/> the magnitude of the equivalent force is the area of the triangle, <m>bh/2</m> and the line of action passes through the centroid of the triangle.
				The horizontal distance from the larger end of the triangle to the centroid is <m>\bar{x} = b/3</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
				Essentially, we're finding the balance point so that the moment of the force to the left of the centroid is the same as the moment of the force to the right.

				The examples below will illustrate how you can combine the computation of both the magnitude and location of the equivalent point force for a series of distributed loads.

					</li>
          <li>

				Pressure is the term used for a force distributed over an area
				<men>

				We will consider the effect of fluid pressure on underwater surfaces, including slanted or curved objects.
				In all cases we will simply ask the question: what is the pressure at each point and how does it change along the surface?
			</p>
      <p>
        Pressure can be measured in two different ways
        <ul>
          <li><term>Absolute pressure</term> is the pressure measured above an absolute or perfect vacuum.
						The absolute pressure of the surrounding atmosphere is approximately <m>\kPa{101.3}</m> or <m>\psinch{14.7}</m>, and a perfect vacuum is 0 psi or 0 kPa.
					</li>
          <li><term>Gage pressure</term> is the pressure indicated by a standard pressure gage.
						The gage reads zero when exposed directly to the atmosphere, positive when the pressure is higher than atmospheric pressure, and negative pressure indicates a vacuum.
						In effect, pressure gages ignores the pressure of the atmosphere which surrounds us.
					</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
				We will use gage pressure for the remainder of the chapter.
			</p>
      <p>
        Commonly used pressure units include:

						1 pascals (Pa) = 1 <m>\text{N}/\text{m}^2</m></li>
          <li>

				At the surface, the gage pressure is zero no matter which unit system you use.
				As you descend, the fluid pressure <m>P</m> increases with depth according to the equation
				<men>
					P = \rho g h
				</men>,
				where:
        <ul>
          <li><m>\rho</m> is the density of a fluid,
					</li>
          <li><m>g</m> is gravitational acceleration, and
					</li>
          <li><m>h</m> is the height of fluid above the point of interest.
					</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
				Since fluid pressure increases linearly with depth, it behaves as a distributed load which increases linearly from 0 at the surface to <m>\rho g h</m> at depth <m>h</m>, acting normal to the surface.
				The pressure can be replaced with an equivalent force acting through the centroid of the triangular loading, with a magnitude equal to the triangular area.
				The pressure on horizontal surfaces is constant, and it is normal to all surfaces.

        Some points to remember when solving fluid pressure problems.
        <ol>
          <li>
						The pressure due to the fluid always acts perpendicular the surface.
					</li>
          <li>
						A particle underwater will feel the same pressure from all directions.
					</li>
          <li>
						Pressure increases linearly with depth.
						<m>P = \rho g h</m></li>
          <li><m>P = \rho g h</m> assumes a constant density and thus is valid only for incompressible fluids like water or oil, but not for compressible fluids like air.
					</li>
          <li>
						In English units, specific weight <m>\gamma</m> is often used instead of density <m>\rho</m> to describe fluids.
						Specific weight is the <em>weight</em> per unit volume of a substance, while density is its <em>mass</em> per unit volume.
						The two properties are related by <m>\gamma = \rho g</m>.
						The specific weight of freshwater at room temperature is about <m>\pqf{62.4}</m>.
					</li>
          <li>
						Gage pressure is the pressure above the surrounding atmospheric pressure.
						Atmospheric pressure is approximately <m>\psinch{14.7}</m> or <m>101.3~\text{kPa}</m>, but since this pressure acts on everything equally and from all directions, the pressure scale can be offset to make the pressure of the surroundings <m>\psinch{0}</m>, gage.
					</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <question>
        <statement>
          <p>
						Does fluid pressure depend on the surface area of the container? For instance, is the pressure below the Atlantic Ocean less than the pressure below the Pacific Ocean since the Pacific is larger?
					</p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
						No.
						Fluid pressure is a function of density and depth only, so the surface area of an ocean or tank is insignificant.
						<me>
							P = \rho g h
						</me>.
						Assuming that the density of seawater and <m>g</m> are the same everywhere under the ocean, the gage pressure depends on depth only.
					</p>
        </answer>
      </question>
      <question>
        <statement>
          <p>
						Compare the pressure at three feet and thirty feet below the surface of freshwater to the atmospheric pressure.
					</p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
						The gage pressure at <m>\ft{3}</m> is
						<me>
							p = \gamma d = \pqf{62.4} \times \ft{3} = \psf{187} = \psinch{1.30}
						</me>.
					</p>
          <p>
						This is
						<me>
							\frac{ \psinch{14.7} + \psinch{1.3}} {\psinch{14.7}} = 1.088
						</me>,
						approximately 9% greater than atmospheric pressure.
					</p>
          <p>
						At <m>\ft{30}</m> below the surface, the pressure is 10 times higher, <m> \psinch{13.0}</m> which is nearly twice atmospheric pressure.
