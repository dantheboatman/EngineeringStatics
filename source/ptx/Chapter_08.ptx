  <title>Internal Forces</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
			One of the fundamental assumptions we make in statics is that bodies are <em>rigid</em>, that is, they do not deform, bend, or change shape.
			While we know that this assumption is not true for real materials, we are building the analytical tools necessary to analyze deformation.
			In this chapter you will learn to compute the forces and moments inside a object which hold it together as it supports its own weight and any applied loads.
		</p>
    <p>
			The chapter begins with a discussion of internal forces and moments and defines a new sign conventions especially for them.
			Next we will determine internal forces at a specific point within a rigid body.
			Finally, we develop three techniques to find internal forces at every point throughout a beam.
			Note that we use the words <term>internal forces</term> when we are referring to both <q>internal forces and internal bending moments.</q></p>
    <p>
			Determination of the internal forces is the first step in the engineering design of a structure.
			A properly designed structure must safely support all expected external loads, including live loads, dead loads, wind and earthquake loads.
			External loads produce internal forces, which in turn creates stresses, strains, and deformations in the structure.
			In a successful design, the shape, size, and material must all be carefully chosen to limit them to safe values.
			You are advised to pay attention, and master this topic.

    <title>Internal Forces</title>
    <p>
			In <xref ref="two-force-bodies"/> you were introduced to axial loadings, which were either tension or compression, or possibly zero.
			This section will explain two other internal forces found in two-dimensional systems, the <term>internal</term><term>shear</term> and <term>internal</term><term>bending moment</term>.
		</p>
    <p>
			Internal forces are present at every point within a rigid body, but they always occur in equal-and-opposite pairs which cancel each other out, so they're not obvious.
			They're there however, and when an object is cut (in your imagination) into two parts the internal forces become visible and can be determined.
		</p>
    <p>
			You are familiar with straight, two-force members which only exist in equilibrium if equal and opposite forces act on either end.
			Now imagine that we cut the member at some point along its length.
			To maintain equilibrium, forces must exist at the cut, equal and opposite to the external forces.
			These forces are internal forces.
		</p>

      <xi:include href="interactives.ptx" xpointer="ggb_tension_compression_interactive"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
			Now let's examine the two-force member shown in <xref ref="dogleg_cut"/>.
			This time, the member is <em>L</em> shaped, not straight, but the external forces must still share the same line of action to maintain equilibrium.
			If you cut across the object, you will obtain two rigid bodies which must also be in equilibrium.
			However, adding an equal and opposite horizontal force at the cut won't produce static equilibrium because the two forces form a couple which causes the piece to rotate.
			This means that something is missing!

			Two-dimensional rigid bodies have three degrees-of-freedom and require three equilibrium equations to satisfy static equilibrium in order to prevent translation in the <m>x</m> direction, the <m>y</m> direction, and to prevent rotation about the <m>z</m> axis.
		</p>
    <p>
			Assuming the material is rigid, the connection between the two halves must resist both translation and rotation, so we can model this connection as a fixed support and replace the removed half of the link with a force reaction <em>and</em> a couple-moment reaction as shown in the free-body diagrams of <xref ref="dogleg-internal"/>.
			This internal loading is actually a simplification of a more complex loading distributed across the section plane.
			The couple <m>\vec{M}</m> represents the net rotational effect of the force system on the surface of the cut.

			The horizontal force can also be resolved into orthogonal components parallel and perpendicular to the cut.
			These components have special names in the context of internal forces.

			The internal force component perpendicular to the cut is called the <term>normal force</term>.
			This is the same internal tension or compression force that we assumed to be the only significant internal load for trusses.
			If the object has an axis, and the cut is perpendicular to it, the normal force may also be properly called an <term>axial force</term>.
		</p>
    <p>
			The internal force component parallel to the cut is called the <term>shear force</term>.
			The word shear refers to the shearing that occurs between adjacent planes due to this force.
			You can get a feel for shearing adjacent planes by sliding two pieces of paper together.
		</p>
    <p>
			The internal couple-moment is called the <term>bending moment</term> because it tends to bend the material by rotating the cut surface.
		</p>
    <p>
			The shear force is often simply referred to as <term>shear,</term> and the bending moment as <term>moment</term>; together with the normal or axial force the three together are referred to as the <q>internal forces</q>.
			The symbol <m>\vec{V}</m> is commonly chosen for the shear force, and <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{P}</m> or <m>\vec{N}</m> for the normal force and <m>\vec{M}</m> for the bending moment.

      <title>Deformation</title>
      <p>
				The controlling design parameter for most engineering systems is deformation.
				Thankfully, due to a property called elasticity, most materials will bend, stretch, and compress, long before they ultimately break.
				For example, when designing the floor in a new building, the floor is often limited to deflecting less than the length of the span in inches, divided by 360.
				Any more deformation than this would be considered disconcerting to the building residents and also start damaging surface materials like drywall.
				For example, for a <m>\ft{20}</m> span, the deflection would need to be less than
				<me>
					\delta = \dfrac{\ft{20} \cdot \dfrac{\inch{12}}{\ft{1}}}{360}=\inch{0.667}
				</me>.
			</p>
      <p/>
      <p>
				To meet this deformation limit, we need to consider the magnitude and location of applied loads, the size and shape of the floor beams, and the material the floor beams are made from.
				As deflection is an internal property of the flooring materials, the first step is to determine the internal forces that arise from the externally applied loads, using the methods of this chapter.

  <section xml:id="VM_sign_convention">
    <title>Sign Conventions</title>
    <p>
			When talking about internal forces our standard sign convention for forces and moments is not good enough.
			We can't, for instance, just call a vertical shear force positive if it points up and negative if it points down, because internal forces always occur in pairs so at any given point a shear force is <em>both</em> up and down.
			The direction of the internal force at a point depends on which side of the cut you're looking at.
		</p>
    <p>
			So to define the state of internal forces at a point we need a better sign convention.
			Although the choice is somewhat arbitrary, agreeing on a <em>standard</em> sign convention allows us to have consistency across our calculations and to communicate the internal state clearly to others.
			The standard sign conventions defined here are used for internal loadings at a point and also for the shear and bending moment diagrams which are discussed in <xref ref="VM_diagrams"/>.
		</p>
    <p>
			Be aware that although this new sign convention applies to internal forces, it doesn't change the sign convention for the equations of equilibrium at all, so you will continue to solve them in the same way you always have.
		</p>
    <p>
      The standard sign convention used for shear force, normal force, and bending moment is shown below.

    <title>Internal Forces at a Point</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
			This section covers the procedure to compute the internal normal force, shear force, and bending moment at a designated point in a multi-force rigid body.
		</p>
      <sidebyside margins="0%" valign="top" widths="60% 40%">
        <stack>
          <p>
					Consider the frame shown in <xref ref="frame_space_diagram"/> consisting of two-force members <m>GD</m> and <m>BE</m>, and multi-force members <m>AD</m> and <m>CF</m>.
					Since no information is provided, we can assume that the components have negligible weight.
					The internal loading within the two-force members is purely axial, but the multi-force members will be subject to the complete set of shear force, normal force, and bending moment.
				</p>
          <p>
					To find the internal forces at a specified point within one of the members, we make an imaginary cut there.
				</p>
          <p><xref ref="frame_1"/> shows the free-body diagram of member <m>AD</m>, with a proposed cut between points <m>D</m> and <m>C</m>. The free-body diagram is shown with reactions for pinned connections at <m>A</m> and <m>C</m> and forces from the two-force members at locations <m>B</m> and <m>D</m>.
				</p>
          <p>
					We then separate the free-body diagram of the member into two independent free-body diagrams, one above the cut and one below.
					This is analogous to the Method of Sections technique of <xref ref="Chapter_06"/>.
					The free-body diagrams for the two sections of the member are shown in <xref ref="frame_2"/>.
					The three internal forces are exposed and labeled <m>V</m>, <m>N</m>, and <m>M</m>.
					Either free-body diagram can be used to solve for the internal forces, so it is wise to choose the easier one.
					Recognizing which one is easier takes practice, but look for the piece with more known and fewer unknown values.
				</p>
          <p>
					Note that the internal forces at the cut are drawn in the positive direction according to the <xref ref="VM_sign_convention" text="custom">sign conventions</xref> for internal forces, that they act in opposite direction either side of the cut, and they cancel out if the object is put back together.
				</p>
          <p>
					This technique can be used to find the internal forces at any point within any object.
					In the examples below we will find the internal loadings at a specific point in load carrying beams.

                <title>Add the internal forces</title>
                <p>
								At each cut, a shear force, a normal force, and a bending moment will be exposed, and these need to be included on the free-body diagram.
							</p>
                <p>
								At this point, we don't know the actual directions of the internal forces, but we do know that they act in opposite directions.
								We will assume that they act in the positive sense as defined by the <xref ref="VM_sign_convention" text="custom"> standard sign convention</xref>.
							</p>
                <p>
								Axial forces are positive in tension and act in opposite directions on the two halves of the cut beam.
							</p>
                <p>
								Positive shear forces act down when looking at the cut from the right, and up when looking at the cut from the left.
								An alternate definition of positive shears is that the positive shears cause clockwise rotation.
								This definition is useful if you are dealing with a vertical column instead of a horizontal beam.
							</p>
                <p/>
                <p>
								Bending moments are positive when the moment tends to bend the beam into a
								smiling U-shape.
								Negative moments bend the beam into a frowning shape.
							</p>
                <p>
								For vertical columns, positive bending moments bend a beam into a C shape and negative into a backward C-shape.
							</p>
                <p>
								The final free-body diagrams look like this.

                <p>
								Horizontal beams should always have assumed internal loadings in these directions at the cut, indicating that you have assumed <em>positive</em> shear, <em>positive</em> normal force and <em>positive</em> bending moments at that point.

                <p>
								You may uses either <acro>FBD</acro> to find the internal forces using the techniques you have already learned.
								So, with a standard <m>xy</m> coordinate system, forces to the right or up are positive when summing forces and counter-clockwise moments are positive when summing moments.

			Regardless of which side is chosen, we get the same results for the internal forces at the chosen point.

			When you solve for the internal forces, the results can be either positive, negative, or sometimes zero.
			Negative values indicate that the actual direction of the load is opposite to the assumed direction.
			Since we assumed all three internal forces were positive as defined by the <xref ref="VM_sign_convention" text="custom">standard sign convention</xref>, a negative answer means that the load actually acts in the opposite direction to the vector shown on the free-body diagram.

      <p>
			Beams are structural elements primarily designed to support vertical loads.
			When designing a beam it is important to locate the points of maximum shear and maximum moment and their magnitudes because that's where the beam is most likely to fail.
			To find these critical points, we need to check the shear force and bending moment at every point along the beam's full length.

			The previous section presented a method to find the shear and bending moment at a single point, which is useful; but in order to find the shear and moment at <em>every</em> point in the object you will need a more powerful approach.
			This can be done by creating a shear and bending moment diagram.
			This section will discuss three related but different methods to produce shear and bending moment diagrams, and conclude with a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

      <title>Shear and Bending Moment Diagrams</title>
      <p>
			Shear and moment diagrams are graphs which show the internal shear and bending moment plotted along the length of the beam.
			They allow us to <em>see</em> where the maximum loads occur so that we can optimize the design to prevent failures and reduce the overall weight and cost of the structure.
		</p>
      <p>
			Since beams primarily support vertical loads the axial forces are usually small, so they will not be considered in this section.
		</p>
      <p>
        Beams can be supported in a variety of ways as shown in <xref ref="beam_supports"/>.
			The common support methods are
        <ul>
          <li><term>Simply Supported</term> Supported by a pin on one end and a roller at the other.
				</li>
          <li><term>Cantilevered</term> Fixed at one end, and unsupported at the other.
				</li>
          <li><term>Overhanging</term> One or both ends overhang the supports.

    <title>Section Cut Method</title>
    <p>
		In this section we'll extend the method of <xref ref="internal_force_at_point"/> where we found the shear force and bending moment at a specific point to make shear and bending moment diagrams.
		The procedure is similar except that the cut is taken at a variable position designated by <m>x</m> instead of at a specified point.
		The analysis produces <em>equations</em> for shear and bending moments as functions of <m>x</m>.
		Shear and bending moment diagrams are plots of these equations, and the internal forces at any particular point can be found by substituting the point's location into the equations.

			As an example, we will use a cantilevered beam fixed to a wall on its left end and subject to a vertical force <m>P</m> on its right end as an example.
			Global equilibrium requires that the reactions at the fixed support at <m>A</m> are a vertical force <m>A_y = P</m>, and a counter-clockwise moment <m>M_A = P L</m>.

      Applying the force equilibrium in the vertical direction gives the following result:

          \frac {\Delta V}{\Delta x} \amp = w
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the limit of both sides as <m>\Delta x</m> approaches 0, we get this important result
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \lim_{\Delta x \to\ 0}\left( \frac {\Delta V}{\Delta x} \right) \amp= \lim_{\Delta x \to\ 0}\left( w \right)

    <p>
		This equation tells us that, at a given location <m>x</m>, the slope of the shear function <m>V(x)</m> there is the value of the loading directly above, <m>w(x)</m>.
		Furthermore, if we multiply both sides by <m>dx</m>, we can integrate to find that
	</p>
    <p><me>

    <p/>
    <p>
		In words, this equation says that over a given distance, the change in the shear <m>V</m> between two points is the area under the loading curve between them.
	</p>
    <p>
		Now looking at the internal bending moments on the <acro>FBD</acro> in <xref ref="arbitrary-load-ex1"/>, when we apply moment equilibrium about the centroid of the element, and take the limit similarly,

          \frac {\Delta M}{\Delta x}\amp=\frac{1}{2}(2V+\Delta V)

    <p>
		This final equation tells us that, the slope of the moment diagram is the value of the shear.
		Furthermore, if we multiply both sides by <m>dx</m>, we can integrate to find that
	</p>
    <p><me>
			\Delta M=\int V\ dx

    <p>
		In words, this equation says that over a given segment, the change in the moment value is the area under the shear curve.

		Hence, the functional relationships between the internal shear force <m>V(x)</m>, internal bending moment <m>M(x)</m> at a point <m>x</m>, and the value of the loading at that point <m>w(x)</m> are simply the derivatives and integrals that you learned in Calculus I.

		If you have a firm grasp on the relations between load, shear and bending moments <xref ref="VM_relations"/>, the graphical method is a quick and intuitive way to draw shear and moment diagrams.
		This technique is really a graphical integration process; you integrate from load <m>w(x)</m> to shear <m>V(x)</m> to moment <m>M(x)</m>, from top to bottom, or differentiate from bottom to top.
	</p>
    <p>
      Shear and bending moment diagrams are governed by equations <xref first="VMV1" last="VMM2"/> and must be consistent with them.

      Shear and bending moment diagram problems should include:
      <ol>
        <li>
				A neat, accurate, labeled free-body diagram of the entire structure, and the work to find the reactions.
				For this work, you may replace the distributed loads with equivalent concentrated loads.
			</li>
        <li>
				A neat, properly scaled diagram of the beam showing its reactions and <q>true</q> loads.
				Distributed loads must be shown this diagram, because their distributed nature is significant.
			</li>
        <li>
				A large graph of the shear and bending moment functions drawn directly below the scaled beam diagram.
				It is convenient to draw this graph on graph paper.
			</li>
        <li>
				The correct shape and curvature for each curve segment: zero, constant slope, polynomial.
				Changes in curve shapes should align with the load which causes them.
				Indicate the scale used for shear and moment, and use a straightedge.
			</li>
        <li>
				Values of shear and moment at maximums, minimums and points of inflection.
			</li>
        <li>
				Any other work need to justify your results.
			</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can draw shear and bending moments efficiently and accurately using this procedure
      <ol>
        <li>
				First, <em>determine the reaction forces</em> and moments by drawing a free-body diagram of the entire beam and applying the equilibrium equations.
				Double check that your reactions are correct.
			</li>
        <li>
				Establish the shear graph with a horizontal axis below the beam and a vertical axis to represent shear.
				Positive shears will be plotted above the <m>x</m> axis and negative below.
			</li>
        <li>
          Make vertical lines at all the <q>interesting points</q>,
          <ie/>
          points where concentrated forces or moments act on the beam and at the beginning and end of any distributed loads.
				This divides the beam into segments between vertical lines.
			
        
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Draw the shear diagram</em> by starting with a dot at <m>x = 0</m>, <m>V = 0</m> then proceeding from left to right until you reach the end of the beam.
					Choose and label a scale which keeps the diagram a reasonable size.
            <ol>
              <li>
							Whenever you encounter a concentrated force, jump up or down by that value
						</li>
              <li>
							Whenever you encounter a concentrated moment, do not jump.
						</li>
              <li>
							Whenever you encounter a distributed load, move up or down by the <q>area</q> under the loading curve over the length of the segment, according to equation <xref ref="VMV2"/>.
							The <q>area</q> is actually a force.
						</li>
              <li>
							The slope of the curve at each point <m>x</m> is given by <xref ref="VMV1"/>.
							Distributed loads cause the shear diagram to have a slope equal to value of the distributed load at that point.
							For unloaded segments of the beam, the slope is zero, i.e.
							the shear curve is horizontal.
							For segments with uniformly distributed load, the slope is constant.
							Downward loads cause downward slopes.
						</li>
              <li>
							The shear diagram should start and end at <m>V = 0</m>.
							If it doesn't, recheck your work.
						</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
				Add another interesting point wherever the shear diagram crosses the <m>x</m>-axis, and determine the <m>x</m> position of the zero crossing.
			</li>
        <li>
				After you have completed the shear diagram, <em>calculate the area under the shear curve</em> for each segment.
				Areas above the axis are positive, areas below the axis are negative.
				The areas represent moments and the sum of the areas plus the values of any concentrated moments should add to zero.
				If they don't, then recheck your work.
			</li>
        <li>
				Establish the moment graph with a horizontal axis below the shear diagram and a vertical axis to represent moment.
				Positive moments will be plotted above the <m>x</m> axis and negative below.
			</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em> Draw and label dots on the moment diagram</em> by starting with a dot at <m>x = 0, M = 0</m> then proceed from left to right placing dots until you reach the end of the beam.
					As you move over each segment move up or down from the current value by the <q>area</q> under the shear curve for that segment and place a dot on the graph.
					In this step, you are applying <xref ref="VMM2"/>.
            <ol>
              <li>
							Positive areas cause the moment to increase, negative areas cause it to decrease.
						</li>
              <li>
							If you encounter a concentrated moment, jump straight up or down by the amount of the moment and place a dot.
							Clockwise moments cause upward jumps and counter-clockwise moments cause downward jumps.
						</li>
              <li>
							When you reach the end of the beam you should return to <m>M = 0</m>.
							If you don't, then recheck your work.

    <title>Integration Method</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
			In <xref ref="VM_relations"/> we learned that loading, shear and bending moments are related by integral and differential equations, and used this knowledge to draw shear and bending moment diagram suing a graphical approach.
			This method is easy and fast in cases when you can easily calculate the areas under the loading and shear curves without integration.
			Beams consisting of point and uniformly distributed loads only do not require the use of the calculus method.
		</p>
      <p>
			However, there are times that the graphical technique falls short when the areas are more complicated than rectangles or triangles.
			For example, a uniformly varying load, which is a first degree linear function of <m>x</m>, integrates to a second degree parabolic shear function, and a third degree cubic moment function.
			To use the graphical method you would need to find the area under the parabolic shear curve to compute the cubic moment.
			When the loading becomes more complex it is better to use perform the integration directly.
		</p>
      <p>
        We will use fundamental equations <xref ref="VMV2"/> and <xref ref="VMM2"/> to find the shear and bending moment functions
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \Delta V\amp =\int_a^b w(x)\ dx \amp \Delta M\amp=\int_a^b V(x)\ dx
          </mrow>
        </md>
        but instead of finding areas and slopes using geometry, we will integrate the load function <m>w(x)</m> to find the <m>\Delta V</m>, then integrate that result to find the <m>\Delta M</m>.
		
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      </p>
      <p>
			These results are the change in shear and moment over a segment; to find the actual shear and moment functions <m>V(x)</m> and <m>M(x)</m> for the entire beam we will need to find initial values for each segment.
			This is equivalent to using boundary conditions to find the constant of integration when solving a differential equation.
			The initial values come from either the final value of the previous segment or from point loads or point moments.
			Because of the requirement for these segment starting values, no segment can be computed in isolation from the other segments.
			Physically this means that the shear and moment along a beam are not just due to the loading in one segment, but are related to the loading on the rest of the beam as well.
		</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_08-determining-loading-functions">
      <title>Determining Loading Functions</title>
      <p>
			Before you can find shear and bending moment functions with integration you must know the equation for the load on each segment of the beam.
			These equations may be given in the problem statement if you're lucky, or you may have to determine them from a loading diagram.
		</p>
      <p>
			When determining equations for loading segments, you may choose either <em>global equations</em>, where all segments use the same origin, usually at the left end of the beam, or <em>local equations</em>, where each segment uses its own origin, usually at the left end of the segment.
			Often local equations are easier because you can simply use the variable <m>x</m> in your equations as opposed to <q><m>x</m> + constant</q>, and you do not have to project the <m>y</m>-intercept values back to an axis system which is not adjacent to the segment.
			See interactive <xref ref="ggb_global_local"/> to explore the difference between local and global equations.
		</p>
      <p>
        When determining equations for the loading segments from the load diagram, consider the following.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <title>No load</title>
            <p>
						Whenever there is no load at all on a segment there will be no change in the shear on the segment.
						On such sections the loading function is
						<me>
							w(x) = 0
						</me>.
						Note that this can only occur when the weight of the beam itself is neglected.
					</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Point Load</title>
            <p>
						A point load is a concentrated force acting at a single point which causes a jump in the shear diagram.
					</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Uniformly Distributed Load</title>
            <p>
						A uniformly distributed load is constant over the segment and results in a linear slope, either a triangle or a trapezoid, on the shear diagram.
						The loading function on such sections is
						<me>
							w(x) = C \qquad V(x) = Cx + b
						</me>.
						The constant value is negative if the load points down, and positive if it points upward.
					</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Uniformly Varying Load </title>
            <p>
						In this case the loading function is a straight, sloping lie forming a triangle or trapezoidal shape.
						The resulting shear function is parabolic.
						The general form of these functions are
						<me>
							w(x) = m x + b \qquad V(x) = \frac{mx^2}{2} + bx + c
						</me>.
						The slope <m>m</m>, intercept <m>b</m>, and constant <m>c</m> must be determined from the situation, and will depend on whether you are writing a global or local equation.
					</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Arbitrary Load</title>
            <p>
						The loading function will be a given function of <m>x</m>.
						<me>
							w(x) = f(x)
						</me>,
						and the shear and moment functions are found by integration.
						<me>
							V(x) = \int f(x) dx \qquad M(x) = \int V(x) dx
						</me></p>
            <p>
						Most gravitational distributed loads are drawn with the arrows pointing down and resting on the beam.
						If you slide these along their line of action so that their tails are on the beam, the tips define the loading equation.

		You have likely realized that in engineering (and life) that there are multiple ways to solve a problem.
		The four different techniques to compute internal forces discussed in this chapter are a demonstration of this.
		In the end, the choice of which method to use is yours; the better you know each method the easier it will be to choose the one which is most applicable and efficient.
	</p>
    <p>
		The list below summarizes each of the four approaches and their advantages and disadvantages.
	</p>
    <list>
      <title>Summary of Methods to find Internal Loadings.</title>
      <ul>
        <li>
				In <xref ref="internal_force_at_point"/> we exposed the internal forces at a specific point inside a rigid body by taking a cut at that location and applying the equilibrium equations.
				This approach is computationally efficient, works for any rigid body and takes advantage of tools you have learned in previous chapters.
				It requires knowledge of sign conventions for internal shear and bending moments, but only reveals values at the selected point.
			</li>
        <li>
				In <xref ref="section_cut_method"/> we generalized the previous approach by taking a cut at a variable location, and analyzed the equilibrium equations in terms of <m>x</m>.
				The results were <em>functions</em> which describe shear and moment at every point within the beam, rather than at a specific location.
				This method requires breaking a beam into loading segments and writing and solving equations for each segment.
				The equations are then plotted to give shear and bending moment diagrams.
			</li>
        <li>
				In <xref ref="graphical_method"/> we used the mathematical relationships between loading, shear, and bending moment to draw shear and moment diagrams directly.
				The method is quick and requires only a few simple computations to determine the critical values.
				The approach provides many cross-checks for accuracy.
				It is most suitable for beams loaded with concentrated forces, concentrated moments, and uniformly distributed loads, but is not usually suitable for more complex distributed loads.
				It is essential to have a solid grasp of the integral and differential relations between loading, shear and moment discussed in <xref ref="VM_relations"/> to use this method.
			</li>
        <li>
				In <xref ref="integration_method"/> we discussed the most general approach to determine internal loads.
				In the approach, the load is described as a piecewise function of <m>x</m>, which is integrated twice to develop equations for shear and moment.
				This method can used for arbitrarily complicated loading distributions, and can be used by software solutions.
