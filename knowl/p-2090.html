<div class="para">The friction force at any point of the contact area will equal the normal force at that point times the kinetic coefficient of friction at that point. If the coefficient of friction and the pressure between the collar and the surface is the same at all points, then the same friction force at every point is the same as well. This does not mean that the moment exerted at every point is equal as well. Elements towards the outside of the contact area cause larger moments than those closer to the center since they have larger moment arms.</div>
