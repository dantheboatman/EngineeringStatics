<div class="para">In this problem, the knowns are the magnitude and direction of force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{B}\)</span> and moment <span class="process-math">\(\vec{C}\)</span> and the dimensions of the beam.</div> <div class="para">The constraints are the frictionless pin at <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and the rocker at <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> The pin prevents translation but not rotation, which means two it has two unknowns, represented by either magnitude and direction, or by two orthogonal components. The rocker provides a force perpendicular to the surface it rests on, which is <span class="process-math">\(\ang{30}\)</span> from the horizontal. This means that the line of action of force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{D}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\ang{30}\)</span> from the vertical, giving us its direction but not its sense or magnitude</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
