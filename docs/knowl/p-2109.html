<div class="para">Area moments of inertia are a measure of the distribution of a two-dimensional area around a particular axis. Fundamentally, the portions of a shape which are located farther from the axis have a greater affect than the parts which are closer. The primary application is in structural engineering and machine design where they are used to determine a structural member’s stiffness. Another application is in Fluid Mechanics where they are used to determine the effect of pressure on a submerged surface. We will use the symbol <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> for this property, along with a subscript to indicate the specific axis, so for example, <span class="process-math">\(I_x\)</span> would indicate the “Area moment of inertia with respect to the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis.”</div>
