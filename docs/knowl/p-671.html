<div class="para">For equilibrium of a particle, usually the origin of the coordinate frame is at the particle, the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis is horizontal, and the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis is vertical just as in a two-dimensional situation. The orientation of the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis is determined by the <dfn class="terminology">right-hand rule</dfn>. Using your <em class="emphasis">right hand</em>, put your palm at the origin and point your fingers along the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis. Then curl your fingers towards the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis. Your thumb will point in the direction of the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis. For example, in the plane of the page with the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis horizontal and to the right and the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis vertical and upwards, the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis will point <em class="emphasis">towards</em> you out of the page. Remember that the three axes are mutually perpendicular, i.e. each axis is perpendicular to both of the others. The right-hand rule is important in many aspects of engineering, so make sure that you understand how it works. Mistakes will lead to sign errors.</div>
