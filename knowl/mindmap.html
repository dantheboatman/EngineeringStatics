Calculus and Physics are the foundation to be able to learn engineering statics. The "Engineering Mechanics Trilogy" is encircled, and the relationships described between the three subjects - statics, dynamics, and solids. Statics is depicted as "no movement". Dynamics is depicted as "Hold on. Everything is moving." Solids is depicted as "it’s what inside that counts". After learning statics, you will move to Solids (mechanics of materials) by learning about shear and moment, frames, and virtual work. Also from the fundamentals of statics you will move to Dynamics, where you will learn more about friction and machines. A common thread between all three subjects is includes equilibrium, moment of inertia, and centroids. Additional content that you’ll add to your Statics knowledge in Solids includes: stress and strain, material properties, and torsion. Additional content you’ll add to your Statics knowledge in Dynamics is the concept that the sum of the forces is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration and that this is NOT equal to zero, as it is in Statics. You will also learn about motion and accelerations.'></div>
