  <title>Friction</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
			Friction is the force which resists relative motion between surfaces in contact with each other.
		</p>
    <p>
      Friction is categorized by the nature of the surfaces in contact and the conditions under which they are interacting.
			There are many different types of friction, some of which are listed below.
      <ol>
        <li><term>Dry friction</term>, which is the force that opposes one solid surface sliding across another solid surface.
				</li>
        <li><term>Rolling friction</term> is the force that opposes motion of a rolling wheel or ball.
				</li>
        <li><term>Fluid friction</term> is the friction between layers of a viscous fluid in motion.
				</li>
        <li><term>Skin friction</term>, also called drag, is the friction that occurs between a fluid and a moving surface.
				</li>
        <li><term>Internal friction</term> is the force resisting the internal deformation of a solid material.
				</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
			An understanding of friction is important factor in the design, functionality and performance of many mechanical systems.
			In this text we will only consider dry friction out of the many types of friction listed above.
			So far, we have only looked at situations where friction could be safely ignored; however, there are many cases where the effect of dry friction is significant.
			These include slipping or tipping, blocks, wedges, screws, belts, bearings, and rotating discs.
			These are the subject of this chapter.

    <introduction>
      <title>Dry Friction</title>
      <p>
				Dry friction, also called <term>Coulomb friction</term>, is a force which appears between two solid surfaces in contact.
				This force is distributed over the contact area and always acts in whichever direction opposes relative motion between the surfaces.
				We will usually simplify the distributed frictional force by representing it as a single concentrated force acting at a point, as we did in <xref ref="distributed-loads"/>.
			</p>
      <p>
				Depending on the details of the situation, dry friction will either hold the object in equilibrium, in which case it is called <term>static friction</term>, or it will retard but not prevent motion, in which case it is called <term>kinetic friction</term>.
			</p>
      <p>
				Consider the football training sled shown in <xref ref="sled_AA"/>.
				Initially, the sled's weight is supported by a normal force acting on the bottom surface that can be considered as a point force directly beneath the center of gravity; there is no friction force.
			</p>
      <p>
				When players begin to push the sled, a friction force will appear along the bottom surface which opposes sliding to the right.
				Both the friction and normal forces can be represented by concentrated horizontal and vertical forces located to the right of the center of gravity.
				This offset is required to maintain rotational equilibrium against the pushing force.
				If the players push hard enough, equilibrium will break and the sled will begin to slide in the direction of the push.
				At this point static friction has transitioned to kinetic friction.

					The force distribution on the bottom of an object being pushed across a surface is complex, and looks approximately like (a).
				</p>
        <p>
					To simplify things, we first decompose the actual force into a distributed <em> normal </em> force perpendicular to the surface, and a distributed <em> friction </em> force parallel to the surface, as shown in the (b).
					These two distributions are further simplified into two concentrated forces representing the normal and friction components of a single resultant force, as show in (c).
					The net resultant force acts at the point required for equilibrium.

      <title>Coulomb Friction</title>
      <p>
				The Coulomb friction model proposes that the force of friction is proportional to the normal force, where the normal force is the force acting perpendicular to the contacting surface.
				<me>
					F_f = \mu N
				</me>
				The constant of proportionality, <m>\mu</m>, is called the friction coefficient.
				<m>\mu</m> is always greater than zero and commonly less than one.
				The friction coefficient can be greater than one for materials that exhibit positive adhesion to each other like silicone rubber, glued surfaces, or gecko's feet.

				Friction has two distinct regions as shown in <xref ref="coulomb-friction"/>, and the value of <m>\mu</m> is different in each region.
				The region from point one to point two, where the force of friction increases linearly with load is called the <term>static friction</term> region.
				Here you must use the <term>coefficient of static friction</term><m>\mu_s</m>.
				The region from point two to point three, where the friction remains roughly constant is called the <term>kinetic friction</term> region.
				In this region you must use the <term>coefficient of kinetic friction</term><m>\mu_k</m>.
			</p>
      <figure xml:id="coulomb-friction">

        <image source="images/coulomb-friction" width="50%"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
				The coefficient of friction suddenly drops at point two, causing the friction force <m>F_f</m> to drop as well.
				Point two is called the point of <term>impending motion</term>, because here the situation is unstable.
				If the applied force increases ever so slightly, the opposing friction force suddenly decreases and the object begins to move.
			</p>
      <p>
				To better understand the behavior of Coulomb friction imagine an object resting on a rough surface as shown in <xref ref="friction-slide-fbd"/>.
				When force <m>P</m> is gradually increased from zero, the normal force <m>N</m> and the frictional force <m>F_f</m> both change in response.
				Initially both <m>P</m> and <m>F_f</m> are zero and the object is in equilibrium.
				The interaction between the two surfaces in contact means that friction is available but it is not engaged <m>F_f=P=0</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
				As <m>P</m> increases, the opposing friction force <m>F_f</m> increases as well to match and hold the object in equilibrium.
				In this static-but-not-impending phase <m>F_f= P</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
				When <m>P</m> reaches point two, motion is impending because friction has reached its maximum value.
				<m>F_{f_\text{max}}=\mu_\text{s} N = P</m>.
				If force <m>P</m> increases slightly beyond <m>F_{f_\text{max}}</m>, the friction force suddenly drops to the kinetic value <m>F_f= \mu_k N</m>.
				The applied force exceeds the frictional force breaking equilibrium and causing the object to accelerate, and accelerating bodies are beyond the scope of Statics!
			</p>
      <p>
				Notice that static friction at impending motion is greater than kinetic friction, because the coefficient <m>\mu_\text{s} \gt \mu_k</m> for most materials.
				Practically, this tells us that once a material starts to move it is easier to keep moving than it was to get it started from rest.
			</p>
      <p>
				If you wonder why we include kinetic friction in a statics course, remember that a sliding body moving at constant velocity is in equilibrium.

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_09-friction-angle-and-friction-resultant">
      <title>Friction Angle and Friction Resultant</title>
      <p>
				Recall that a resultants is the sum of two or more vectors.
				The <term>friction resultant</term> is the vector sum of the friction and normal forces.
				Since these two forces are perpendicular, the magnitude of the friction resultant can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
				<men>
					R = \sqrt{F_f^2 + N^2}
				</men></p>
      <p>
				The <term>friction angle</term><m>\phi_s</m> is defined as the angle between the friction resultant and the normal force.
				At impending motion, the friction angle reaches its maximum value.
				The friction resultant and friction angle are used for screw, flexible belt, and journal bearing type problems.
			</p>
      <p>
				The maximum friction angle <m>\phi_s</m> is directly related to the coefficient of static friction <m>\mu_\text{s}</m> since the friction angle <m>\phi_s</m> is the internal angle of the right triangle formed by the normal force <m>N</m>, the friction resultant <m>R</m>, and the friction force <m>F</m>.
				Hence:
				<men>
					\tan \phi_s = \frac{F}{N} \qquad \phi_s = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{F}{N} \right)
				</men></p>
      <p>
				In <xref ref="resultant-force"/> a block of weight <m>W</m> is pushed sideways by force <m>P</m>.
				The reaction forces can be represented as separate friction and normal forces, or as combined friction force <m>R</m> acting at friction angle <m>\phi_s</m>, measured from the normal direction.

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_09-normal-forces">
      <title>Normal Forces</title>
      <p>
				The normal force supporting the object is distributed over the entire contact surface, however it is common on two dimensional problems to replace the distributed force with an equivalent concentrated force acting at a particular spot on the contacting surface, as we did in <xref ref="Chapter_07"/>.
				This point is rarely at the exact center of the contact surface.
			</p>
      <p>
				This is illustrated in <xref ref="ggb-distributed-normal-force"/> where we see in that an object at rest has a uniformly distributed normal force along the bottom surface and the resultant normal force is located directly below the weight.
				The friction force is not engaged.
				When a pushing force <m>F_\text{push}</m> is applied, the distributed normal force changes shape, and the resultant normal force <m>N</m> shifts to the right to maintain equilibrium.
				The resultant normal force continues to shift to the right the harder you push.
			</p>
      <p>
				This can be understood from the principle of a two-force body.
				As we discussed <xref ref="statically-equivalent-loadings" text="custom">previously</xref>, the combined push and weight can be represented a single load acting down and to the right.
				The friction and normal forces can be combined into a single reaction force acting up and to the left at a point on the bottom surface.
				These two forces must share the same line of action to maintain equilibrium, so as the pushing force increases, the friction angle changes and the point shifts to the right.
				If the point shifts off the physical object then the required friction is greater than the friction available and motion begins.

			This section focuses on the various ways a rigid body in equilibrium might begin to move.
			The point at which an object starts to move is called the point of impending motion.
		</p>
    <p>
			The interactive in <xref ref="ggb_slip_tip"/> shows a box sitting on a rough surface.
			Imagine that we start pushing on the side of the box with a gradually increasing force.
			Initially, friction between the block and the incline will increase to maintain equilibrium, and the box will sit still.
		</p>
    <p>
			As we continue to increase the force there are two possibilities; the maximum static friction force will be reached and the box will begin to slide, or the pushing force and the friction force will create a sufficient couple to cause the box tip on its corner.

    <p>
      The easiest way to determine whether the box will slip, tip, or stay put is to solve for the maximum load force <m>P</m> twice, once assuming slipping and a second time expecting tipping, then compare the actual load to these maximums.
			This process is summarized in the following three steps:

      <p>
		The goal of engineering design is to forecast and plan for all the ways that something can fail.
		The challenge is to know the questions to ask and the data to gather to model all possible failure modes.
		The controlling failure is the mode which occurs at the smallest load.

		A wedge is a tapered object which converts a small input force into a large output force using the principle of an inclined plane.
		Wedges are used to separate, split or cut objects, lift weights, or fix objects in place.
		The mechanical advantage of a wedge is determined by the angle of its taper; narrow tapers have a larger mechanical advantage.
	</p>
    <p>
		Wedges are used in two primary ways:
	</p>
    <p><em> Low friction wedges </em> are a simple machines which allows users to create large output forces to move objects using comparatively small input forces.
		In the log splitter in <xref ref="log-splitter"/>, hydraulic ram pushes a log into a stationary wedge.
		The normal force pushes the two halves of the log apart while the friction force <m>F_f</m> is opposes the pushing force <m>P</m>.
	</p>
    <p><em> High-friction (self-locking) wedges </em> control the location of objects or hold them in place.
		Examples include doorstop wedges and carpentry wedges.
		The sailor in <xref ref="shoring-wedges"/> is hammering two wooden wedges towards each other to create large compressive forces to secure shoring timbers during a damage control operation.

		Luckily the analysis of low- and high-friction wedges are identical and they are quite similar to the multi-force body equilibrium problems we saw in <xref ref="Chapter_05"/> and <xref ref="Chapter_06"/>.
		The main difference is the inclusion of friction from all non-smooth contact surfaces.
		The directions of both the normal and friction forces on the free-body diagrams are defined below.
	</p>
    <p><em> Normal forces </em> act between bodies act perpendicular to the contacting surfaces.
		All normal forces on a free-body diagram should be pointing towards the body because wedges are always subjected to compression.
	</p>
    <p><em> Friction forces </em> are between bodies which act parallel or tangential to the contacting surfaces and are created by the microscopic or large scale roughness of the surfaces.
		All friction forces on a free-body diagram should be drawn pointing in the direction which resists relative motion at the point of contact.
	</p>
    <p>
		The key added challenge of solving wedge problems is that the angled faces of wedges usually need to be resolved into components in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, unless a different coordinate system is used.
	</p>
    <p>
		One of the critical steps in solving block or wedge problems is to determine which force is engaging the friction of the system.
		Start by drawing the friction forces on the body where this force acts.
		As you pass the friction and normal forces to adjacent free-body diagrams, you must always show them as equal and opposite, action-reaction pairs.
		This is illustrated in the following example.

				A screw thread is uniform shape which spirals around the inside or outside surface of a cylinder or cone.
				Like wedges, screws are simple machines.
				They are essentially a ramp or inclined plane wrapped into a helix, and the input to screws is torque rather than linear force.
				The mechanical advantage of a screw depends on its <term>lead</term>, which is the linear distance the screw travels in one revolution.
			</p>
      <p>
				Screws used to fix objects in place are called <term>fasteners</term>, and screws used to move objects are called <term>power screws</term> or <term>lead screws</term>.
				In this chapter we will focus on power screws.
			</p>
      <p>
				A power screw assembly includes a nut with matching internal threads which fits around the screw.
				There are two ways that a power screw can operate based on the movement of the screw and nut.
				In a scissors jack, the operator rotates the threaded rod with a crank fitted to the nut on the right, which is not threaded but acts as a thrust bearing.
				The nut on the left moves along the stationary screw to raise the load.
				In the C-clamp, the nut is stationary and the screw translates through as it rotates.
				In either case, a small moment on the screw can cause enormous forces on the nut, with the added benefit of the force being applied at a precise location as controlled by the screw.

        Left-handed screws are less common but are found in some applications, especially:
        <ul>
          <li>
						machines where reverse-threading prevents them from loosening gradually under the torque of the moving part.
						For example, the left pedal on a bicycle.
					</li>
          <li>
						machines where the movement of the screw creates dual motion, like a hand-screw wood clamp.
					</li>
          <li>
						situations where you do not want to mix up constituents.
						Cutting torches use right-hand thread for the oxygen and left-hand threads for the acetylene connections.
					</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
					The motion of left-handed screws can either be thought of as opposite the right-hand rule or conforming to the same relationships if you use your left hand.
					Notice that right-handed threads slope up to the right, while left-handed threads slope down.
					Note that turning a thread upside-down does not reverse its handedness.

      <title>Moment to Reach Impending Motion</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
						The focus of this section is to find the magnitude of a moment which will push a screw to impending motion.
						Impending motion is the threshold between the system holding still and moving, so knowledge of the moment required at impending motion allows you to interpret what happens to the screw system in static but not impending-motion conditions as well.
					</p>
        <p>
						Assuming that motion is impending means that we can use the coefficient of static friction <m>\mu_\text{s}</m> and the related friction angle <m>\phi_\text{s}</m>.
						Recall from earlier in this chapter, that the friction angle <m>\phi_\text{s}</m> is related directly to <m>\mu_\text{s}</m> the by the equation:
					</p>
        <p><me>
							\phi_\text{s}=\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{F}{N} \right )
						</me></p>
        <p>
						We now have the tools assembled to derive the relationship between a screw's geometry and the applied loads.

        <title>Applied Force Opposes Impending Motion</title>
        <p>
						In this scenario we will examine the magnitude of moment <m>M</m> required to raise a screw to impending motion against the applied force <m>W</m> as shown in <xref ref="screw-jack"/>.
						To eliminate any references to the orientation of the screw and force like up, down, left, or right, this type of motion will be described as <q> the applied force opposes impending motion.
						</q> This case occurs any time you are applying a force to an object with a screw.
					</p>
        <p>
						The free-body diagram in <xref ref="thread-element"/> shows the moment <m>\vec{M}</m> required to raise a load <m>\vec{W}</m> and the friction and normal forces acting on a slice of thread.
						These must be summed over the entire length of the thread to find the total friction and normal forces.

						Recall that the friction force <m>F</m> direction always opposes the impending motion of the point of contact <mdash/> in this case, the screw threads.
						Also, the thread angle <m>\alpha</m> determines the angle of the normal force <m>N</m> from the centerline of the screw.

					</p>
        <p>
						Practically, this equation says that the moment to move a screw against an applied force must overcome the screw friction, represented by <m>\phi_\text{s}</m>, and the component of the load on the screw, represented by <m>\alpha</m>.

        <title>Applied Force Supports Impending Motion</title>
        <p>
						When the impending motion of the screw is in the direction of the applied force, we can also state that the <q> applied force supports impending motion.
						</q> This case occurs any time you remove a force held by a screw, like lowering the load supported by the screw jack in <xref ref="screw-jack"/>.
					</p>
        <p>
          This situation is a bit more complicated than the previous one, because there are three different possibilities depending on the relative magnitude of the friction angle <m>\phi_\text{s}</m> and the thread angle <m>\alpha</m>.
						Cases include
          <ol>
            <li>
              <title>Self-locking.
								<m>\phi_\text{s}\gt \alpha</m></title>
              <p>
									In this case the load will not cause the screw to rotate by itself,
								</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Unwind-with-load.<m>\phi_\text{s} \lt \alpha</m></title>
              <p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <title>Impending motion.
								<m>\phi_\text{s}=\alpha</m></title>
              <p>
									This case is the boundary between the two other cases.
								</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          In all three cases the thread angle <m>\alpha</m> is the angle between the normal force <m>N</m> and the centerline of the screw, and the friction angle <m>\phi_\text{s}</m> is the angle between the friction resultant force <m>R</m> and the normal force <m>N</m>.

          <p>
							Self-locking screws are the type of screws that you will encounter most often in mechanical systems as they are highly predictable.
							They have sufficient friction available to hold their applied load even with no moment applied.
							Thus, they can safely carry a load in a static-but-not impending condition until you wish to overcome the excess friction by applying a moment <m>M'</m> to push them to impending motion.

        </paragraphs>
        <p><alert>Unwind-with-load screw</alert> As its name implies, an unwind-under-load screw will start turning unless a moment <m>M''</m> is applied to keep the screw at or beyond impending motion.
						The moment to push a self-locking screw to impending motion <m>M'</m> is in the opposite direction as the moment to keep unwind-under-load screws at impending motion <m>M''</m>, as <m>M''</m> is in the same direction as the moment to loosen (or raise) a screw.
						These unwind-with-load screws are not often found in mechanical systems, except for in dynamic motion control systems, where the screw is used to slow down motion.
					</p>
        <p>
						To be designed in an unwind-with-load condition, a screw must have a quite steep thread angle <m>\alpha</m> and minimal friction between the threads and nut, which reduces <m>\phi_\text{s}</m>.

        <p>

							M''=Wr \tan(\alpha-\phi_\text{s})
						</men></p>
        <p><alert>Impending-motion screw</alert> As the derived equations for all three unwind-with-load screw cases push the screw towards impending motion, when a screw is already at impending motion, it requires no applied moment to maintain equilibrium; however, this case is mechanically unstable.
						If the load increases slightly the screw will begin to unwind-under-load, whereas if the load decreases slightly the screw will become self-locking.
					</p>
        <p>

						</men></p>
        <p>
						The concept of an applied force in the direction of impending motion works equally well for either a force applied in the impending motion direction of a screw, or for a force applied to the impending motion direction of a nut.
						An example of the first case is the screw jack lowering a load, and the second could be a scissors jack that has a rotating but non-translating screw, plus a non-rotating but translating nut.

					The only interaction force between the belt and pulley is the distributed normal force.
					Due to the symmetry of this example, the <m>x</m> components of the distributed force all cancel and the resultant is purely vertical.

      <title>Friction in Flat Belts</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
						When friction is available to oppose the sliding, the tensions in the two sides of the belt will not be equal and friction will cause the pulley to rotate.
						Alternately if the pulley is driven by an external moment, friction will cause one tension to increase and the other to decrease.
						This, of course, is the point of a belt and pulley system <mdash/> power transmission from the belt to the pulley or vice-versa.
					</p>
        <p><xref ref="different-tension-a"/> shows a free-body diagram of a belt and pulley in equilibrium. The net moment caused by the two belts and the applied moment <m>M</m> are in balance. The system may be stationary, or it may be rotating at a constant velocity; however, it is impossible to tell from this diagram which direction.
					</p>
        <p><xref ref="different-tension-b"/> shows a free-body diagram of the belt. Since <m>T_+</m> is greater than <m>T_-</m>, in the absence of friction, the left side will move up, and the right side will move down, as indicated by the arrows which indicate the relative motion of belt with respect to the pulley. A distributed friction force <m>F_\text{belt}</m> between the belt and pulley which opposes the relative motion and maintains rotational equilibrium. A distributed normal force also exists to maintain equilibrium in the <m>y</m> direction.
					</p>
        <p><xref ref="different-tension-c"/> shows a free-body diagram of the pulley. The frictional and normal forces acting on the pulley are equal and opposite to those acting on the belt. The arrow indicates that the impending relative motion of the pulley with respect to the belt is counter-clockwise. The actual direction of rotation is not known or indicated. Friction always acts opposite to the direction of relative motion.

						Increasing <m>M</m> or the belt tension ratio <m>T_+/T_-</m> will increase the power transmitted until the belt starts to slip.
						This occurs when the friction increases to the maximum available value <m>F_\text{max} = \mu_s M</m>.
						At this point, motion (slipping) is impending.
					</p>
        <p>
						We are interested in determining the range of values for the tension forces where the belt does not slip relative to the surface.
						For a flat belt, the maximum value for <m>T_+</m> depends on the magnitude of <m>T_-</m>, the static coefficient of friction between the belt and the surface <m>\mu_s</m>, and the contact angle <m>\beta</m> between the belt and the surface.

						You will need to use the geometry of the pulleys to find the contact angle <m>\beta</m> between the belt and pulley.
						The belt will depart the pulley at a point of tangency, which is always perpendicular to a radius.
						To find <m>\beta</m> create one or more right triangles using the incoming and outgoing belt paths and apply complementary angles to relate the belt geometry to the contact angle.
						There is no simple rule for transferring cable angles over to the contact angle, but in general, extend radial lines from the center of the pulley out to the belt's tangential lines.
						Next, create right triangles with each radial line and work to find all the angles which add up to the contact angle <m>\beta</m>.

        <title>Belt Tension</title>
        <p>
						We have seen that when there is friction between a belt and a pulley, the tensions on either end of the belt are not the same.
						In previous problems, we simply guessed a direction for an unknown force, and then used the sign of the numerical answer to confirm or reverse our assumption.
						Unfortunately, this does not work for flexible belts, where we must make the correct determination before starting computations.
						So, how can we determine which side has the larger tension, and which side is smaller?
					</p>
        <p>
						The following discussion guides you through two methods to make this decision.
						<xref ref="find-max"/> shows a pulley and belt system and the associated free body diagrams.
						The pulley is driven by a motor which supplies a counterclockwise moment of <m>M</m>.
						The belt is fixed, and holds the pulley in equilibrium until slipping occurs.
						Both the pulley and belt are assumed massless.
					</p>
        <p>
						The grey arrows indicate the direction of <em>impending</em> motion.
						This is the motion which will occur if the belt slips.
						For the belt, which is fixed, this impending motion is <em>relative</em> to the pulley.
						For the pulley, motion is impending <em>relative</em> to the belt, but since it can actually rotate it also has <em>absolute</em> impending motion with respect to the earth.

              <title>Method 1: Draw free-body diagrams and sum tensions along the cable</title>
              <p>
									Friction always opposes impending relative motion at the point of contact, so if you can determine the direction the belt will potentially slip, you also know the direction of the friction force.
									You can find out which tension is larger and which is smaller by drawing a free-body diagram of the belt and summing forces along it.
								</p>
              <p>
                The free-body diagram <xref ref="find-max-b"/> shows the forces acting on the pulley, which are:
                <ul>
                  <li>
											Reaction force <m>A_y</m> from the fixed center axle.
										</li>
                  <li>
											A distributed normal force <m>\Sigma N</m> acting radially along the contact surface with the belt.
											<fn>The distributed normal forces is not symmetrical as drawn, but actually biased towards the right, in order to have the net leftward force required to oppose the net friction acting to the right.
											Fortunately, the actual shape is not significant to us.</fn></li>
                  <li>
											A distributed friction force <m>\Sigma F</m> acting along the contact surface, opposing moment <m>M</m> and the impending motion of the pulley.
										</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                The free-body diagram <xref ref="find-max-c"/> shows the forces acting on the belt, which are:
                <ul>
                  <li>
												The belt's internal tension forces, labeled <m>T_1 </m> and <m>T_2</m> since at this point we don't know their relative magnitudes.
											</li>
                  <li>
												A distributed normal force <m>\Sigma N</m> acting radially along the contact surface between the pulley and belt.
												These are the distributed normal forces on the pulley transferred equal-and-opposite to the belt.
											</li>
                  <li>
												A distributed friction force <m>\Sigma F</m> acting along the surface of the belt, again equal-and-opposite to the corresponding forces on the pulley.
												Since the belt is not actually moving these forces oppose the belt's <em>relative impending motion</em> with respect to the pulley.
											</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Summing forces along the belt, we find that the tension <m>T_1</m> plus the distributed friction force <m>\Sigma F</m> must equal <m>T_2</m> for equilibrium.
                <md>
                  <mrow>
                    \Sigma F_\text{belt} \amp = 0

                  <mrow>
                    T_1+\Sigma F -T_2 \amp = 0

                Therefore, the larger tension <m>T_+ = T_2</m> and the smaller tension <m>T_- = T_1</m>.

              <title>Method 2: Larger tension acts in the direction of the impending motion of the belt</title>
              <p>
										Following the logic of Method 1, it turns out that the larger tension always points in the direction of impending motion of the belt.
										It does not matter if the impending motion is relative as here with a fixed belt, or absolute as when the belt moves around a fixed object.
									</p>
              <p>
										There are multiple ways to determine the smaller and larger tensions in a flexible belt system.
										You can use the interactive below to develop your intuition on the relationship between belt tension, pulley moment, friction and relative motion.

						A flat belt pulley interacts with one surface of the belt.

						The sum of the normal force vertical components is the same for a flat belt or V-belt.

						The belt should not contact the bottom of the groove, or else the wedge effect is lost

						As we can see from the equation above, smaller groove angle and steeper sides result in a larger maximum tension ratio, resulting in higher torque transmission.
						The trade-off with steeper sides, however, is that the belt becomes wedged more firmly in the groove and requires more force to unwedge itself as it leaves the pulley.
						This unwedging force decreases the efficiency of the belt-driven system.
						An alternate design choice would be a chain-drive which carries very high-tension differences efficiently.

						A bearing is a machine element used to support a rotating shaft.
						Bearing friction exists between the rotating shaft and the supporting bearing.
						Though other types of bearings exist including, ball, roller and hydrodynamic, we will focus on <em>dry friction</em> journal bearings.
						Oil lubricated journal bearings require a knowledge of fluid mechanics to analyze, while dry journal bearings have point contact between the shaft and bearing and thus can be analyzed in Statics, they are subject to greater wear and heat build-up than other types of bearings; thus, the use of dry journal bearings is only advisable in situations where there is limited motion.

						A dry friction journal bearing consists circular bearing surface which supports a rotating or stationary shaft.
						The support force acts at the single point of tangency of the two circular surfaces.
						The bearing prevents shaft motion in the radial directions but does not prevent axial motion due to shaft thrust.

        The most straightforward process to relate the load, normal and friction forces for a journal bearing is by performing the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
								Assume that the shaft and bearing opening have the same radius, but draw the shaft a bit smaller to emphasizes the contact point at the point of tangency.
							</li>
          <li>
								Combine the normal and friction forces into a single friction resultant force
								<me>
									\vec{R}=\vec{F}+\vec{N}
								</me>.
							</li>
          <li>
								Determine the radius of the friction circle, <m>r_f</m>, which is a circle around the center tangent to the friction resultant <m>R</m>.
								The friction circle radius is a function of the shaft radius <m>r</m> and the friction angle <m>\phi_\text{s}</m>.
								<me>
									r_f = r \sin \phi_\text{s} =\tan^{-1} F/N
								</me>.
							</li>
          <li>
								Finally, draw a free-body diagram of the shaft with all applied loads and the friction resultant <m>R</m>, then solve the equations of equilibrium to find the unknowns.

							In this section we saw that the contact point shifts in the direction of the relative impending motion of the bearing or opposite to the relative motion of the shaft; This is true for dry friction bearings, but with oil lubricated bearings, the shaft starts by a shift this way, but as the shaft speed increases a <em>hydrodynamic oil wedge</em> forms which shifts the shaft in the other direction in much the same way that a water skier lifts up and skims the water at high speeds.
