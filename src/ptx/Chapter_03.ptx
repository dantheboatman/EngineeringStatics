<title>Equilibrium</title>


<p>Engineering statics is the study of rigid bodies in equilibrium so it's appropriate to begin by defining what we mean by <em>rigid bodies</em> and what we mean by <em>equilibrium</em>.</p>
<p>A <term>body</term> is an object, possibly made up of many parts, which may be examined as a unit. In statics, we consider the forces acting on the object as a whole and also examine it in greater detail by studying each of its parts, which are bodies in their own right.  The choice of the body is an engineering decision based on what we are interested in finding out.  We might, for example, consider an entire high-rise building as a body for the purpose of designing the building's foundation, and later consider each column and beam of the structure to ensure that they are strong enough to perform their individual roles.</p>
<p>A <term>rigid body</term> is a body which doesn't deform under load, that is to say, an object which doesn't bend, stretch, or twist when forces are applied to it.  It is an idealization or approximation because no objects in the real world behave this way; however, this simplification still produces valuable information.  You will drop the rigid body assumption and study deformation, stress, and strain in a later course called <pubtitle>Strength of Materials</pubtitle> or <pubtitle>Mechanics of Materials</pubtitle>. In that course you will perform analysis of non-rigid bodies, but each problem you do <em>there</em> will begin with the rigid body analysis you will learn to do <em>here</em>.</p>
<p>A body in <term>equilibrium</term> is not accelerating.  As you learned in physics, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, and is a vector quantity. For linear motion, <me>\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}</me>.</p>
<p>For an object in equilibrium <m>\vec{a} = 0</m> which implies that the body is either stationary or moving with a constant velocity <me>\vec{a} = 0 \implies \begin{cases}\vec{v}=0\\\vec{v}=C\end{cases}</me>.</p>
<p>The acceleration of an object is related to the net force acting on it by <term>Newton's Second Law</term><me> \Sigma\vec{ F} = m \vec{a}</me>.</p>
<p>So for the special case of static equilibrium Newton's Law becomes <men xml:id="SigmaF">\Sigma\vec{F} = 0</men>.</p>
<p>This simple equation is one of the two foundations of engineering statics.</p>
<p>There are several ways to think about this equation.  Reading it from left to right it says that <em>if all the forces acting on a body sum to zero, then the body will be in equilibrium</em>.  If you read it from right to left it says that <em>if a body is in equilibrium, then all the forces acting on the body must sum to zero</em>. Both interpretations are equally valid but we will be using the second one more often.  In a typical problem equilibrium of a body implies that the forces sum to zero, and we use that fact to find the unknown forces which make it so.  Remember that we are talking about vector addition here, so the sums of the forces must be calculated using the rules of vector addition; you won't get correct answers if you can't add vectors!</p>
<p>We'll be using several different techniques to add vectors in this chapter, which may lead to some confusion.  It doesn't matter, mathematically, which technique you use but part of the challenge and reward of statics is learning to select the best tool for the job at hand; to select the simplest, easiest, fastest, or clearest way to get to the solution.  You'll do best in this course if can use multiple approaches to solve the same problem.</p>
<p>In <xref provisional="chapter 4"/> we will add another requirement  for equilibrium, namely equilibrium equation <xref provisional="sigmaM"/> which says the the forces which cause rotational motion and angular acceleration <m>\vec{\alpha}</m> also must sum to zero, but for the problems of this chapter the only condition we'll need for equilibrium is Equation <xref ref="SigmaF"/>.</p></section><section xml:id="ch3-1d-particles">

<title>Particles</title>


<p>We'll begin our study of Equilibrium with the simplest possible object in the simplest possible situation <mdash/> a <term>particle</term> in a <term>one-dimensional coordinate system</term>. Also, in this chapter and the next all forces will be represented as <term>concentrated forces</term>. In later sections the we will address more complicated situations, higher dimensions, and distributed forces, but beginning with very simple situations will help you to develop engineering sense and problem solving skills which will be useful later.</p>
<p>The defining characteristic of a <term>particle</term> is that all forces that affect it are <term>coincident</term> or <term>concurrent</term>, not that it is small. The moon, earth and sun can all be treated as particles, but we probably won't encounter them in statics since they're not in equilibrium. Forces are coincident/concurrent if their lines of action all intersect at a single, common point. Two or more forces are also considered concurrent if they share the same line of action. One practical consequence of this is that particles are never subjected to forces which cause rotation. So a see-saw, for example, is not a particle because the weights of the children tend <fn>We say <em>tend</em> to cause rotation because in a Statics context all objects are static <mdash/> so no <em>actual</em> rotation occurs.</fn> to cause rotation.</p>
<p>Another consequence of concurrent forces is that Equation <xref ref="SigmaF"/> is the only equilibrium equation that applies. This vector equation can be used to solve for a maximum of one unknown per dimension. If you find yourself trying to solve a two-dimensional particle equilibrium problem and you are seeking more than two unknowns, it's likely that you have missed something and need to re-read the question.</p>
<p>Another simplification we will be making is to treat all forces as <term>concentrated forces</term>. Concentrated forces act at a single point, have a well defined line of action, and can be represented with an arrow <mdash/> in other words, they are vectors. Real forces don't actually act at a single mathematical point, but concentrating them is intuitive and will be justified in a <xref provisional="distributed loads">later chapter</xref>. You're already familiar with the concept if you have ever placed all the weight of an object at its center of gravity.</p></section><section xml:id="CH03-1d-particles">

<subsection xml:id="CH03-1d-particles-a-simple-case">

<title>A simple case</title>


<p>Consider the weight suspended by a rope shown in <xref ref="suspended-weight"/>.  Diagrams of this type are called <term>space diagrams</term>; they show the objects as they exists in space.  </p>
<p>In mechanics we are interested in studying the forces acting on objects and in this course, the objects will be in equilibrium.  The best way to do this is to draw a diagram which focuses on the forces acting on the object, not the mechanisms that hold it in place.  We call this type of diagram a free body diagram because it shows the object disconnected or freed from its supporting mechanisms.  You can see the free body diagram for this situation by moving the slider in the interactive to position two. This shows that there are two forces acting on the object; the force of the rope holding it up, and the weight of the object which is trying to pull it to earth and which we treat as acting at its center of gravity.</p><sidebyside widths="55% 40%" margins="0%">
<p>The actual shape of the weight is not important to us, so it can simply be represented with a dot, as shown when the view control is in position three.  The forces have been slid along their common line of action until they both act on the dot, according to the <xref provisional="principle of transmissibility">principle of transmissibility</xref>.  This diagram in view three is completely sufficient for this situation.</p><figure xml:id="suspended-weight">

<p>Drawing free body diagrams can be surprisingly tricky. The reason for this is that you must identify all the forces acting on the object and correctly represent them on the free body diagam. If you fail to account for all the forces, include additional ones, or represent them incorrectly, your analysis will surely be wrong.</p>
<p>So what kind of analysis can we do here?  Admittedly not much.  We can find the tension in the rope caused by a particular weight and use it to select an appropriately strong rope, or we can determine the maximum weight a particular rope can safely support.</p>
<p>The actual analysis is so trivial that you've probably already done it in your head, nevertheless, there are several ways to approach it which will be shown next.</p><investigation xml:id="one-D-Vector-Addition">

<p>We conclude that force <m>\vec{T}</m> is equal and opposite to <m>\vec{W}</m>, that is, since the weight is acting down, the rope acts with the same magnitude but up.</p>
<p><term>Tension</term> is the magnitude of the rope's force. Recall that the magnitude of a vector is always a positive scalar.  We use normal (non-bold) typefaces or absolute value bars surrounding a vector to indicate its magnitude. For any force <m>\vec{F}</m>, <me>F = \vert\vec{F}\vert</me>.</p>

<p>We can also formulate this example in terms of unit vectors.  Recall that <m>\jhat</m> is the unit vector which points up. It has a magnitude of one with no units associated.

<p>In the previous example, the unit vector <m>\jhat</m> completely dropped out of the equation leaving only the coefficients of <m>\jhat</m>.  This will be the case whenever you add vectors which all act along the same line of action.</p>
<p>The coefficients of <m>\ihat</m>, <m>\jhat</m>, and <m>\khat</m> are known as the <term>scalar components</term>. A scalar component times the associated unit vector is a force vector.</p>
<p>When you use scalar components, the forces are represented by scalar values and the equilibrium equations are solved using normal algebraic addition rather than vector addition. This leads to a slight simplification of the solution as shown in the next example. </p><investigation xml:id="One-D-Addition-Scalar">

<title>Scalar Components</title>


<p>The scalar component of a vector is a <em>signed</em> number which indicates the vector's <term>magnitude</term> and <term>sense</term>, and is usually identified by a symbol with a subscript that indicates the line of action of the vector.</p>
<p>So for example, <m>F_x = \N{10}</m> is a scalar component. We can tell it's not a vector because it <m>F_x</m> is not bold. <m>\N{10}</m> is the magnitude of the associated vector; the subscript <m>x</m> indicates that the force acts "in the <m>x</m> direction," in other words it acts on a line of action which is parallel to the <m>x</m> axis; and the (implied) positive sign means that the vector points towards the positive end of the <m>x</m>- axis <mdash/> towards positive infinity.  So a scalar component, while not a vector, contains all the information necessary to draw the corresponding vector.  Be careful not to confuse scalar components with vector magnitudes.  A force with a magnitude of <m>\N{10}</m> can point in any direction, but can never have a negative magnitude.</p>
<p>Scalar components can be added together algebraically, but only if they act <q>in the same direction.</q>  It makes no sense to add <m>F_x</m> to <m>F_y</m>. If that's what you want to do, first you must convert the scalar components to vectors, then add them according to the rules of vector addition.</p><investigation xml:id="One-D-Scalar-Addition">

<title>Two-force Bodies</title>


<p>As you might expect, a <term>two-force body</term> is a body with two forces acting on it, like the weight just discussed. As we just saw, in order for a two-force body to be in equilibrium the two forces must add to zero.  There are only three possible ways that this can happen:  </p>
<p>The two forces must either 
<ul label="square">
<li>share the same line of action, have the same magnitude, and point away from each other, or</li>
<li>share the same line of action, have the same magnitude, and point towards each other, or</li>
<li>both forces must have zero magnitude.</li></ul></p>
<p>When two forces have the same magnitude but act in diametrically opposite directions, we say that they are <term>equal and opposite</term>. When equal and opposite forces act on an object and they point towards each other we say that the object is <term>in compression</term>, when they point away from each other the object is <term>in tension</term>.  Tension and compression describe the internal state of the object.</p><figure>

<title>Introduction</title>


<p>You are probably familiar with the three-dimensional <term>cartesian coordinate system</term> with orthogonal <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>- axes used to locate objects in 3-D space.  We will be working with that system later but now we will study situations where everything of importance occurs in a 2-dimensional plane and the third dimension is not involved. Studying two-dimensional problems is worthwhile, because they illustrate all the important principles of Engineering Statics while being easier to visualize and less mathematically complex.</p>
<p>We will normally work in the <q>plane of the page,</q> that is, a two-dimensional Cartesian plane with a horizontal <m>x</m> axis and a vertical <m>y</m> axis.  This coordinate system can represent either the front, side, or top view of a system as appropriate.  In some problems it may be worthwhile to <term>rotate the coordinate</term> system, that is, to establish a coordinate system where the <m>x</m> axis and <m>y</m> axis are not longer horizontal and vertical.  This is usually done to simplify the mathematics by avoiding simultaneous equations.  See <xref provisional="rotate coordinate system"/>.</p></subsection><subsection xml:id="general-procedure">

<title>General Procedure</title>


<p>The general procedure for solving equilibrium of a particle (or concurrent force) problems in two dimensions is to:
<ol>
<li><em>Identify the particle.</em>  The particle will be the object or point where the lines of action of all the forces intersect.</li>
<li><em>Establish a coordinate system.</em>  Normally this will be a system with the origin at the particle and a horizontal <m>x</m> axis and a vertical <m>y</m> axis, though it may be advantageous to align one axis with an unknown.</li>
<li><em>Draw a free body diagram.</em> The <acro>FBD</acro> shows the object and all the forces acting on it, and defines the symbols we will use.  Every force should be labeled with a <em>roman letter</em> to represent its magnitude and, unless it aligns with a coordinate axis, a <em>greek letter</em> or degree measure for its direction.</li>
<li><em>State any given values</em> and identify the unknown values.</li>
<li><em>Find trivial angles.</em> Some angles may be easily found from the geometry of the problem.  If that is the case, draw a simple, labeled triangle and use trigonometry to determine the measure of the angle.</li>
<li><em>Count knowns and unknowns.</em> At this point you should have no more than two unknowns remaining.  If you don't, reread the problem and look for overlooked information.  When solving mechanics problems, it is always helpful to know what you know and what you are looking for and this information changes as you work through your solution.</li>
<li><em>Formulate equilibrium equations.</em> Based on the free body diagram, and using the symbols you have selected, formulate an equilibrium equation using one of the methods described in this section.  The choice of method is up to you, and as you gain experience you will be able to identify the 'best' approach.</li>
<li><em>Simplify.</em> Use algebra to simplify the equilibrium equations. Get them into a form where the unknown values are alone on the left of the equals sign.  Work symbolically as long as you can and avoid the temptation to insert numeric values prematurely, because this tends to lead to errors and obscures the relationships between the forces and angles.</li>
<li><em>Substitute values for symbols.</em>  When your equilibrium equations have been fully simplified in symbolic form, pull out your calculator and substitute the known values and calculate the unknowns.  Indicate the units of your results, and underline or box your answers.</li>
<li><em>Check your work.</em>  Have you made any algebra or trig mistakes?  If you add the forces graphically do they appear to add to zero?   Do the results seem reasonable given the situation?   Have you included appropriate units?  If you have time, work the problem using another approach and compare answers.</li></ol></p></subsection><subsection xml:id="ForceTriangleMethod">

<title>Force Triangle Method</title>


<p>The force triangle method is applicable to situations where there are (exactly) three forces acting on a particle, and no more than two unknown magnitudes or directions.</p>
<p>If such a particle is in equilibrium then the three forces must add to zero.  Graphically, if you arrange the force vectors tip-to-tail, they will form a closed, three-sided polygon, <ie/> a triangle. This is illustrated in <xref ref="fig-force-triangle"/>.  </p><figure xml:id="fig-force-triangle">

<p>We must assume that the block is in equilibrium, that is, either motionless or moving at a constant velocity in order to use the equilibrium equations.  We will represent the block's weight and the force between the incline and the block as concentrated forces.  The force of the inclined surface on the block must act in a direction which is normal to the surface since it is frictionless and can't prevent motion along the surface.</p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Free Body Diagram</title>


<p>You should always begin a statics problem by drawing a free body diagram.  It gives you an opportunity to think about the situation, identify knowns and unknowns, and define symbols.  </p>
<p>We define three symbols, <m>W</m>, <m>N</m>, and <m>P</m>, representing the weight, normal force, and the applied force respectively.

<p>The free body can be a quick sketch or an accurate drawing but it must show <em>all</em> the forces acting on the particle and define the symbols.  In most cases you won't know the magnitudes of all the forces, so the lengths of the vectors are just approximate. </p></stack></sidebyside>

<title>Results</title>


<p>In steps 6 and 7, Geogebra tells us that  <c>p = (0.438;10.0°)</c> which means force <m>P</m>  is 0.438 units long with a direction of 10°, similarly  <c>n = (1.02;115°)</c> means <m>N</m> is 1.02 units long at 115°. These angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive <m>x</m> axis.</p>
<p>These are not the answers we are looking for, but we're close.  Remember that for this diagram, our scale is <me>1 \text{ unit} = 100 \text{ lbs}</me>, so scaling the lengths of  <c>p</c> and  <c>n</c> by this factor gives</p>

<p>If you use technology such as Geogebra, as we did here, or CAD software to draw the force triangle, it will accurately produce the solution.</p>
<p>If technology isn't available to you, such as during an exam, you can still use a ruler and protractor draw the force triangle, but your results will only be as accurate as your diagram.  In the best case, using a sharp pencil and carefully measuring lengths and angles, you can only expect about two significant digits of accuracy from an hand drawn triangle.  Nevertheless, even a roughly drawn triangle can give you an idea of the correct answers and be used to check your work after you use another method to solve the problem.</p></postlude></investigation></subsection><subsection xml:id="Trigonometric-Method">

<p>The general approach for solving particle equilibrium problems using the trigonometric method is to:

<li>Draw and label a free body diagram.</li>
<li>Rearrange the forces into a force triangle and label it.</li>
<li>Identify the knowns and unknowns.</li>

<p>There must be no more than two unknowns to use this method, which may be either magnitudes or directions. During the problem setup you will probably need to use the geometry of the situation to find one or more angles.</p>

<title>Utility Pole</title>

<prelude>
<p>You are undoubtedly familiar with utility poles which carry electric, cable and telephone lines, but have you ever noticed as you drive down a winding road that the poles will switch from one side of the road to the other and back again?  Why is this?</p>
<p>If you consider the forces acting on the top of a pole beside a curving section of road you'll observe that the tensions of the cables produce a net force towards the road.  This force is typically opposed by a <lq/>guy wire<rq/> pulling in the opposite direction which prevents the pole from moving (tipping over) due to unbalanced forces.  The power company tries to keep poles beside road segments with convex curvature. If they didn't switch sides, the guy wire for poles at concave curves would extend into the road... which is a poor design.</p></prelude><statement>
<p>Consider the utility pole next to the road shown below. A top view is shown in the right hand diagram. If each of the six cables pulls with a force of <m>\kN{10.0}</m>, determine the magnitude of the tension in the guy wire.  </p><sidebyside width="40%"><image source="images/pole.png"/><image source="images/utilitypole"/></sidebyside></statement><answer>

<title>Assumptions </title>


<p>A utility pole isn't two-dimensional, but we will consider the top view and forces in the horizontal plane only.</p>
<p>It also isn't a concurrent force problem because the lines of action of the forces don't all intersect at a single point.  However,  we can make it into one by replacing the forces of the three cables in each direction with a single force three times larger.  This is an example of an <em>equivalent transformation</em>, a trick engineers use frequently to turn complex situations into  simpler ones.  It works here because all the tensions are equal, and the outside wires are equidistant from the center wire.  You must be careful to to justify all equivalent transformations, because they will lead to errors if they are not applied correctly.  Equivalent transformations will be discussed in greater detail in  <xref provisional="equivalent tranformation"/> later.  </p></paragraphs><paragraphs>

<title>Procedure</title>


<p>Since the rod is frictionless, it cannot prevent the slider from moving vertically. Consequently the slider will only be in equilibrium is if the resultant of the three load forces is horizontal.  Since a horizontal force has no <m>y</m> component, we can establish this equilibrium condition:</p>
<p><me>R_y = \Sigma F_y = A_y + B_y + C_y = 0</me></p>
<p> Inserting the known values into the equilibrium relation and simplifying gives an equation in terms of unknown angle <m>\alpha</m>.</p>

<p>This is a single equation with a single unknown, although is is not particularly easy to solve with algebra.  On approach is described <url href="https://socratic.org/questions/59e5f259b72cff6c4402a6a5">here</url>. An alternate approach is to use technology to graph the function <m>y(x) = 2 + 2 \sin x - 3 \cos x</m>.  The roots of this equation correspond to values of <m>\alpha</m> which satisfy the equilibrium condition above.  The root occurring closest to <m>x=0</m> will be the answer corresponding to our problem, in this case <m>\alpha = 22.62°</m> which you can verify by plugging it back into the equilibrium equation.  Note that -90° also satisfies this equation, but it is not the solution we are looking for.</p><sidebyside><image source="images/solution-slider"/></sidebyside>
<p>Once <m>\alpha</m> is known, we can find the reaction force by adding the <m>x</m> components of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>.</p>

<p>By inspection the sum of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> acts to the right, and the resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m> is the vector sum of <m>R_x</m> and <m>R_y</m>.  In this case, because <m>R_y</m> = 0, </p>

<title>Particles in Three Dimensions</title>

<introduction>
<p>The world we live in has three dimensions.  One and two dimensional textbook problems have been useful for learning the principles of engineering mechanics, but to model real-world problems we will have to consider all three dimensions.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, all the principles you have learned so far still apply, but many students have difficulty visualizing three-dimensional problems drawn on two-dimensional paper and the mathematics becomes a bit harder. It is especially important to have good diagrams and keep your work neat and organized to avoid errors.  </p></introduction><subsection xml:id="ch3-3d-particles-three-dimensional-coordinate-frame">

<title>Three-Dimensional Coordinate Frame</title>


<p>We need a coordinate frame for three dimensions, just as we did in two dimensions, so we add a third orthogonal axis <m>z</m> to our existing two-dimensional frame.</p>
<p>For equilibrium of a particle, usually the origin of the coordinate frame is at the particle, the <m>x</m> axis is horizontal, and the <m>y</m> axis is vertical just as in a two-dimensional situation.  The <m>z</m> axis is determined by the <xref ref="rhr2" text="custom">right hand rule</xref>.  Using your <em>right hand</em>, put your palm at the origin and point your fingers along the positive <m>x</m> axis.  Then curl your fingers towards the positive <m>y</m> axis.  Your thumb will point in the direction of the positive <m>z</m> axis.  In this case, if the positive <m>x</m> axis is horizontal and to the right, and the positive y-axis is vertical and upwards, then the positive <m>z</m> axis will be coming <em>towards</em> you.  Remember that the three axes are mutually perpendicular, <ie/> each axis is perpendicular to both of the others.  The right hand rule is important in many aspects of engineering, so make sure that you understand how it works.  Mistakes will lead to sign errors.</p></subsection><subsection xml:id="ch3-3d-particles-free-body-diagrams">

<title>Free Body Diagrams</title>


<p>Drawing a <acro>FBD</acro> in three-dimensions can be difficult.  It is sometimes hard to see things in three-dimensions when they are drawn on a two-dimensional sheet.  Consequently, it is important to carefully label vectors and angles, but not to clutter up the diagram with too much and/or unnecessary information.  When working in two-dimensions, you only need one angle to determine the direction of the vector, but when working in three-dimensions you actually need three angles.  When drawing the free body diagram, you usually only label one of these, many times you don’t label any angles, but instead use geometry to show the direction that the vector points.</p></subsection><subsection xml:id="ch3-3d-particles-angles">

<title>Angles</title>


<p>As stated above, when working in three dimensions you actually need three angles to determine the direction of the vector, namely, the angle with respect to the <m>x</m> axis, the angle with respect to the <m>y</m> axis and the angle with respect to the <m>z</m> axis. The three angles mentioned above are not necessarily located in any of the coordinate planes.  Think of it this way <mdash/> three points determine a plane, and in this case, the three points are: the origin, the tip of the vector, and a point on an axis.  The plane made by those three points is not necessarily the <m>xy</m>, <m>yz</m>, or <m>xz</m> plane.  It is most likely a <q>tilted</q> plane.</p><interactive xml:id="three-d-vector-direction-theta" platform="geogebra" width="100%" aspect="3:2" preview="images/3d-vector.png"><slate xml:id="rotate-3d-vec" surface="geogebra" source="images/3d-vector.ggb" aspect="3:2" width="95%"> showResetIcon(true); </slate><instructions>Rotate the diagram to see the force and angles in space.</instructions></interactive>
<p>The angle the vector makes with the positive <m>x</m>-axis is usually labeled <m>\theta_x</m>, but any Greek letter will do.  The angle the vector makes with the positive <m>y</m> axis is usually labeled <m>\theta_y</m>; and the angle the vector makes with the positive <m>z</m> is is usually labeled <m>\theta_z</m>.</p>
<p>As with two dimensions, angles can be determined from geometry <mdash/> a distance vector going in the same direction as the force vector. This is the three-dimensional equivalent of similar triangles that you used in the two-dimensional problems.  </p>
<p>If you know that the line of action of a force vector goes between two points, then you can use the distance vector that goes from one point to the other to determine the angles.  </p>
<p>Let’s suppose that the line of action goes through two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, and the direction of the force is from <m>A</m> towards <m>B</m>.  The first step in determining the three angles is to write the distance vector from point <m>A</m> towards point <m>B</m>.  Let’s call this vector <m>r_{AB}</m>.  Starting at point <m>A</m>, you need to determine how to get to point <m>B</m> by moving in each of the three directions.  Ask yourself: to get from point <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m> do I have to move in the <m>x</m> direction? If so, how far do I have to travel?  This becomes the <m>x</m> component of the vector <m>r_{AB}</m> namely <m>r_{AB_x}</m>.  Next, to get from point <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m> how far do I move in <m>y</m> direction? This distance is <m>r_{AB_y}</m>.  Finally, to get from point A to point B how far do I move in the z-direction?  This distance is <m>r_{AB_z}</m>.  </p>
<p>When writing these components pay attention to which way you move along the axes.  If you travel towards the positive end of an axis, the corresponding component gets a positive sign.  Travel towards the negative end results in a negative sign. The sign is important.</p>
<p>Once you have determine the components of the distance vector <m>r_{AB}</m>, then determine the total distance from point <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> using the <xref ref="distance_formula_3d" text="custom">three-dimensional Pythagorean Theorem</xref>.</p>
<p><me>{r_{AB}}= \sqrt{(r_{AB_x})^2 + (r_{AB_y})^2 +(r_{AB_z})^2}</me></p>
<p>Lastly, the angles are determined by the direction cosines, namely</p>
<p><md><mrow>\cos \theta_x \amp = \dfrac{R_{AB_x}}{R_{AB}}  \quad \amp \cos \theta_y \amp= \dfrac{R_{AB_y}}{R_{AB}} \quad \amp \cos \theta_z \amp = \dfrac{R_{AB_z}}{R_{AB}}</mrow></md></p>
<p>Since the force vector has the same line of action as the distance vector, by the three-dimensional version of similar triangles, </p>
<p><md><mrow>\dfrac{R_{AB_x}}{R_{AB}} \amp = \dfrac{F_x}{F} \quad \amp \dfrac{R_{AB_y}}{R_{AB}} \amp = \dfrac{F_y}{F} \quad \amp \dfrac{R_{AB_y}}{R_{AB}} \amp = \dfrac{F_y}{F}</mrow></md></p>
<p>So,  </p>
<p><md><mrow>F_x \amp = \left(\dfrac{R_{AB_x}}{R_{AB}}\right) F  \quad \amp F_y \amp = \left(\dfrac{R_{AB_y}}{R_{AB}}\right) F \quad \amp F_z \amp = \left(\dfrac{R_{AB_z}}{R_{AB}}\right) F </mrow></md></p>
<p>Now, that is a bit of math there, but the important things to remember are:
<ul label="square">
<li>You need three angles to determine the direction of a force in three dimensions.</li>
<li>You can use the geometry to get them from a distance vector that lies along the line of action of the force.</li></ul></p></subsection><subsection xml:id="ch3-3d-particles-general-procedure">

<title>General Procedure</title>


<p>The general procedure for solving equilibrium of a particle (or concurrent force) problems in three dimensions is essentially the same as for two dimensions using the components method.  The major differences are that you must be very careful about the orientation and direction of each axis of the coordinate frame and the angles each vector makes with each axis.  When working in three dimensions there are three important angles, but the general procedure is the same.  The overall procedure is presented here and then each of the new steps is explained in more detail.
<ol>
<li><em>Identify the particle.</em> The particle will be the object or point where the lines of action of all the forces intersect.</li>
<li><em>Establish a coordinate system.</em> Normally this will be a system with the origin at the particle or directly below the particle, a horizontal <m>x</m> axis, a vertical <m>y</m> axis, and the <m>z</m> axis coming out of the page and towards you.  It is important to follow the right-hand rule when defining the coordinate system.</li>
<li><em>Draw a free body diagram.</em> The <acro>FBD</acro> shows the object and all the forces acting on it, and defines the symbols we will use.  Every force should be labeled with a roman letter to represent its magnitude. Appropriate angles should be represented by a greek letter  with a subscript indicating which axis the angle of the vector is measured against.</li>
<li><em>State any given values</em> and identify the unknown values.</li>
<li><em>Determine the direction of each of the force vectors.</em> Angles are usually determined by the geometry.</li>
<li><em>Count knowns and unknowns.</em> At this point you should have no more than three unknowns remaining. If you don't, reread the problem and look for overlooked information. When solving mechanics problems, it is always helpful to know what you know and what you are looking for and this information changes as you work through your solution.</li>
<li><em>Formulate equilibrium equations.</em> Based on the free body diagram and using the symbols you have selected, formulate the three equilibrium equations.</li>
<li><em>Simplify.</em> Use algebra to simplify the equilibrium equations. Get them into a form where the unknown values are alone on the left of the equals sign. Work symbolically as long as you can and avoid the temptation to insert numeric values prematurely, because this tends to lead to errors and obscures the relationships between the forces and angles.</li>
<li><em>Substitute values for symbols.</em> When your equilibrium equations have been fully simplified in symbolic form, pull out your calculator and substitute the known values and calculate the unknowns. Indicate the units of your results, and underline or box your answers.</li>
<li><em>Check your work.</em> Have you made any algebra or trig mistakes? If you add the components of the forces, do they add to zero? Do the results seem reasonable given the situation? Have you included appropriate units?</li></ol></p></subsection></section><section xml:id="Chapter_03-examples">
