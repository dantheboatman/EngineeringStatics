    <title>Equilibrium</title>
    <p>
			Engineering statics is the study of rigid bodies in equilibrium so it's appropriate to begin by defining what we mean by <em>rigid bodies</em> and what we mean by <em>equilibrium</em>.
		</p>
    <p>
			A <term>body</term> is an object, possibly made up of many parts, which may be examined as a unit.
			In statics, we consider the forces acting on the object as a whole and also examine it in greater detail by studying each of its parts, which are bodies in their own right.
			The choice of the body is an engineering decision based on what we are interested in finding out.
			We might, for example, consider an entire high-rise building as a body for the purpose of designing the building's foundation, and later consider each column and beam of the structure to ensure that they are strong enough to perform their individual roles.
		</p>
    <p>
			A <term>rigid body</term> is a body that doesn't deform under load, that is to say, an object which doesn't bend, stretch, or twist when forces are applied to it.
			It is an idealization or approximation because no objects in the real world behave this way; however, this simplification still produces valuable information.
			You will drop the rigid body assumption and study deformation, stress, and strain in a later course called Strength of Materials or Mechanics of Materials.
			In that course, you will perform analysis of non-rigid bodies, but each problem you do <em>there</em> will begin with the rigid body analysis you will learn to do <em>here</em>.
		</p>
    <p>
			A body in <term>equilibrium</term> is not accelerating.
			As you learned in physics, acceleration is velocity's time rate of change and is a vector quantity.
			For linear motion,
			<me>
				\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}
			</me>.
		</p>
    <p>
			For an object in equilibrium <m>\vec{a} = 0</m> which implies that the body is either stationary or moving with a constant velocity
			<me>
				\vec{a} = 0 \implies \begin{cases}\vec{v}=0\\\vec{v}=C\end{cases}
			</me>.
		</p>
    <p>
			The acceleration of an object is related to the net force acting on it by <term>Newton's Second Law</term><me>
				\Sigma\vec{ F} = m \vec{a}
			</me>.
		</p>
    <p>
			So for the special case of static equilibrium Newton's Law becomes
			<men xml:id="SigmaF">\Sigma\vec{F} = 0
			</men>.
		</p>
    <p>
			This simple equation is one of the two foundations of engineering statics.
		</p>
    <p>
			There are several ways to think about this equation.
			Reading it from left to right it says that <em>if all the forces acting on a body sum to zero, then the body will be in equilibrium</em>.
			If you read it from right to left it says that <em>if a body is in equilibrium, then all the forces acting on the body must sum to zero</em>.
			Both interpretations are equally valid but we will be using the second one more often.
			In a typical problem equilibrium of a body implies that the forces sum to zero, and we use that fact to find the unknown forces which make it so.
			Remember that we are talking about vector addition here, so the sums of the forces must be calculated using the rules of vector addition; you won't get correct answers if you can't add vectors!
		</p>
    <p>
			We'll be using all of the different vector addition techniques introduced in <xref ref="vector_algebra_2D"/>, which may lead to some confusion.
			It doesn't matter, mathematically, which technique you use but part of the challenge and reward of statics is learning to select the best tool for the job at hand; to select the simplest, easiest, fastest, or clearest way to get to the solution.
			You'll do best in this course if can use multiple approaches to solve the same problem.
		</p>
    <p>
			In <xref ref="Chapter_05"/> we will add another requirement for equilibrium, namely equilibrium equation <xref ref="SigmaM2"/> which says the forces which cause rotational motion and angular acceleration <m>\boldsymbol{\alpha}</m> also must sum to zero, but for the problems of this chapter the only condition we'll need for equilibrium is <m>\Sigma\vec{F} = 0</m>.
		</p>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="ch3-1d-particles">
    <title>Particles</title>
    <p>
			We'll begin our study of Equilibrium with the simplest possible object in the simplest possible situation <mdash/> a <term>particle</term> in a <term>one-dimensional coordinate system</term>.
			Also, in this chapter and the next all forces will be represented as <term>concentrated forces</term>.
			In later sections, we will address more complicated situations, higher dimensions, and distributed forces, but beginning with very simple situations will help you to develop engineering sense and problem-solving skills which will be useful later.
		</p>
    <p>
			The defining characteristic of a particle is that all forces that act on it are coincident<fn>Two lines are coincident when one lies on top of the other.</fn> or concurrent<fn>Two or more lines are concurrent if they intersect at a single point.</fn>, not that it is small.
			Forces are coincident if they have the same line of action, and concurrent if they intersect at a point.
			The moon, earth and sun can all be treated as particles, but we probably won't encounter them in statics since they're not in equilibrium.
			Forces are coincident/concurrent if their lines of action all intersect at a single, common point.
			Two or more forces are also considered concurrent if they share the same line of action.
			One practical consequence of this is that particles are never subjected to forces that cause rotation.
			So a see-saw, for example, is not a particle because the weights of the children tend <fn>We say <q>tend to cause rotation</q> because in a static's context, all objects are static <mdash/>
			so no actual rotation occurs.</fn> to cause rotation.
		</p>
    <p>
			Another consequence of concurrent forces is that Equation <xref ref="SigmaF"/> is the only equilibrium equation that applies.
			This vector equation can be used to solve for a maximum of one unknown per dimension.
			If you find yourself trying to solve a two-dimensional particle equilibrium problem and you are seeking more than two unknowns, it's likely that you have missed something and need to re-read the question.
		</p>
    <p>
			Another simplification we will be making is to treat all forces as <term>concentrated</term>.
			Concentrated forces act at a single point, have a well-defined line of action, and can be represented with an arrow <mdash/> in other words, they are vectors.
			Real forces don't actually act at a single mathematical point but concentrating them is intuitive and will be justified in a <xref ref="distributed-loads">later chapter</xref>.
			You're already familiar with the concept if you have ever placed all the weight of an object at its center of gravity.

      <title>A simple case</title>
      <p>
				Consider the weight suspended by a rope shown in <xref ref="suspended-weight"/>.
				Diagrams of this type are called <term>space diagrams</term>; they show the objects as they exist in space.
			</p>
      <p>
				In mechanics we are interested in studying the forces acting on objects and in this course, the objects will be in equilibrium.
				The best way to do this is to draw a diagram that focuses on the forces acting on the object, not the mechanisms that hold it in place.
				We call this type of diagram a free-body diagram because it shows the object disconnected or freed from its supporting mechanisms.
				You can see the free-body diagram for this situation by moving the slider in the interactive to position two.
				This shows that there are two forces acting on the object; the force of the rope holding it up, and the weight of the object which is trying to pull it to earth, which we treat as acting at its center of gravity.
			</p>
      <sidebyside margins="0%" widths="45% 50%">
        <p>
					The actual shape of the weight is not important to us, so it can simply be represented with a dot, as shown when the view control is in position three.
					The forces have been slid along their common line of action until they both act on the dot, which is an example of an <xref ref="equivalent-tranformations" text="custom"> equivalent transformation</xref> called the <q>Principle of Transmissibility.</q> This diagram in view three is completely sufficient for this situation.
				</p>
        <figure xml:id="suspended-weight">

          <xi:include href="interactives.ptx" xpointer="ggb_weight_interactive"/>
        </figure>
      </sidebyside>
      <p>
				Drawing free-body diagrams can be surprisingly tricky.
				The reason for this is that you must identify all the forces acting on the object and correctly represent them on the free-body diagram.
				If you fail to account for all the forces, include additional ones, or represent them incorrectly, your analysis will surely be wrong.
			</p>
      <p>
				So what kind of analysis can we do here? Admittedly not much.
				We can find the tension in the rope caused by a particular weight and use it to select an appropriately strong rope, or we can determine the maximum weight a particular rope can safely support.
			</p>
      <p>
				The actual analysis is so trivial that you've probably already done it in your head, nevertheless several ways to approach it will be shown next.

				In the vector approach we will use the <xref ref="SigmaF" text="custom">equation of equilibrium</xref>.

      <p>
				The scalar component of a vector is a <em>signed</em> number which indicates the vector's <term>magnitude</term> and <term>sense</term>, and is usually identified by a symbol with a subscript which indicates the line of action of the vector.
			</p>
      <p>
				So for example, <m>F_x = \N{10}</m> is a scalar component.
				We can tell it's not a vector because it <m>F_x</m> is not bold.
				<m>\N{10}</m> is the magnitude of the associated vector; the subscript <m>x</m> indicates that the force acts <q>in the <m>x</m> direction,</q> in other words it acts on a line of action which is parallel to the <m>x</m> axis; and the (implied) positive sign means that the vector points towards the positive end of the <m>x</m> axis <mdash/> towards positive infinity.
				So a scalar component, while not a vector, contains all the information necessary to completely describe and draw the corresponding vector.
				Be careful not to confuse scalar components with vector magnitudes.
				A force with a magnitude of <m>\N{10}</m> can point in any direction, but can never have a negative magnitude.

      <title>Two-force Bodies</title>
      <p>
				As you might expect from the name, a <term>two-force body</term> is a body with two forces acting on it, like the weight just discussed.
				As we just saw, in order for a two-force body to be in equilibrium the two forces must add to zero.
				There are only three possible ways that this can happen:
			</p>
      <p>
        The two forces must either
        <ul>
          <li>
						share the same line of action, have the same magnitude, and point away from each other, or
					</li>
          <li>
						share the same line of action, have the same magnitude, and point towards each other, or
					</li>
          <li>
						both forces have zero magnitude.
					</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
				When two forces have the same magnitude but act in diametrically opposite directions, we say that they are <term>equal-and-opposite</term>.
				When equal and opposite forces act on an object and they point towards each other we say that the object is <term>in compression</term>, when they point away from each other the object is <term>in tension</term>.
				Tension and compression describe the internal state of the object.

      <p>
        Did you notice that last three examples in <xref ref="two-force-body-examples"/> did not include the object's weight? These are simplifictions that ignore the object's weight to make them two-force bodies.
				If the object's weight was included, it would be a <em>three-force</em> body.
				This approximation is justifiable when the object's weight is small in comparison with the tensile or compressive forces.
				In this case, we say that the weight is <term>negligable</term>,
        <ie/>
        small enough to neglect.
				Also note that all these examples show single forces acting at each point.
				If several forces act at a point, they should be combined into a single resultant force acting there.
			
      
      
      
      
      </p>
      <p>
				Two force bodies appear frequently in multipart structures and machines which will be covered in <xref ref="Chapter_06"/>.
				Some examples of two force bodies are struts and linkages, ropes, cables and guy wires, and springs.

        <title>Locating the Center of Gravity</title>
        <p>
					As we will see in <xref ref="Chapter_07"/>, the center of gravity is the point where all the weight of an object can be considered to be concentrated.
				</p>
        <p>
					An object suspended by a cable or a frictionless pin is a two-force body.
					When hung freely it will naturally rotate until its center of gravity lies directly beneath the support point to ensure that the lifting force and the weight share the same line of action.
					This means that the center of gravity of an object can be found by suspending it from several different points, and noting intersection of lines drawn straight down from the hook (like a plumb bob).
				</p>
        <p>
					In practical terms, to safely lift a heavy object with a chain fall or crane, you must always ensure that the hook is directly above the center of gravity before hoisting the load.
					The load will be unstable if lifted from any other point.

									We'll solve this with scalar components because there's no need for the additional complexity of the vector approaches in this simple situation.

                <p>
									We'll align the <m>x</m> axis with the rope with positive to the right as usual to establish a coordinate system.
								</p>
                <p>
									Assume that the pull of each team can be represented by a single force.
									Let force <m>M</m> be supplied by the Marines and force <m>A</m> by the Airmen; call the tension in the rope <m>T</m>.
								</p>
                <p>
									Assume that the weight of the rope is negligible; then the rope can be considered a particle because both forces lie along same line of action.

									We find out that both teams pull with the same force.
									This was probably obvious without drawing the free-body diagram or solving the equilibrium equation.
								</p>
                <p>
									It may seem equally obvious that if both teams are pulling with <m>\lb{1500}</m> in opposite directions that the tension in the rope must be <m>\lb{3000}</m>.
									This is wrong however.
								</p>
                <p>
									The tension in the rope <m>T</m> is an example of an internal force and in order to learn its magnitude we need a free-body diagram which includes force <m>T</m>.
									To expose the internal force we take an imaginary cut through the rope and draw (or imagine) a free-body diagram of either half of the rope.

				The force triangle is a graphical representation of the vector <xref ref="SigmaF">equilibrium equation</xref>.
				It can be used to solve for unknown values in multiple different ways, which will be illustrated in the next two examples.
				In <xref ref="Frictionless-Incline"/> We will use a graphical approach to find the forces causing equilibrium, and in <xref ref="cargo_boom"/> we will use trigonometry to solve for the unknown forces mathematically.
			</p>
      <p>
				In the next example we will use technology to draw a scaled diagram of the force triangle representing the equilibrium situation.
				We are using <url href="https://geogebra.org" visual="geogebra.org">Geogebra</url> to make the drawing, but you could use CAD, another drawing program, or even a ruler and protractor as you prefer.
				Since the diagram is accurately drawn, the lengths and angles represent the magnitudes and directions of the forces which hold the particle in equilibrium.

                <p>
									We must assume that the block is in equilibrium, that is, either motionless or moving at a constant velocity in order to use the equilibrium equations.
									We will represent the block's weight and the force between the incline and the block as concentrated forces.
									The force of the inclined surface on the block must act in a direction that is normal to the surface since it is frictionless and can't prevent motion along the surface.

                <p>
									The knowns here are the weight of the block, the direction of the applied force, and the slope of the incline.
									The slope of the incline provides the direction of the normal force.

									You should always begin a statics problem by drawing a free-body diagram.
									It allows you to think about the situation, identify knowns and unknowns, and define symbols.
								</p>
                <p>
									We define three symbols, <m>W</m>, <m>N</m>, and <m>P</m>, representing the weight, normal force, and applied force respectively.
									The angles could be given symbols too, but since we know their values it isn't necessary.

											In most cases, you won't know the magnitudes of all the forces, so the lengths of the vectors are just approximate.

                    <li>
											Start by placing point <m>A</m> at the origin.
										</li>
                    <li>
											Draw force <m>\vec{W}</m> straight down from <m>A</m> with a length of 1, and place point <m>B</m> at its tip.
											The length of this vector represents the weight.

                    <li>
											We know the direction of force <m>\vec{P}</m> but not its magnitude.

										</li>
                    <li>
											Similarly we know force <m>\vec{N}</m> acts at 25<degree/> from vertical because it is perpendicular to the inclined surface, and it will close the triangle.
											So draw line <m>CA</m> passing through point <m>A</m> and at a 25<degree/> angle from the <m>y</m> axis.

									In steps 6 and 7, Geogebra tells us that <c>p = (0.438;10.0°)</c> which means force <m>P</m> is 0.438 units long with a direction of 10<degree/>, similarly <c>n = (1.02;115°)</c> means <m>N</m> is 1.02 units long at 115<degree/>.
									These angles are measured counter-clockwise from the positive <m>x</m> axis.

									Remember that for this diagram, our scale is

									If you use technology such as Geogebra, as we did here, or CAD software to draw the force triangle, it will accurately produce the solution.
								</p>
                <p>
									If technology isn't available to you, such as during an exam, you can still use a ruler and protractor to draw the force triangle, but your results will only be as accurate as your diagram.
									In the best case, using a sharp pencil and carefully measuring lengths and angles, you can only expect about two significant digits of accuracy from a hand-drawn triangle.
									Nevertheless, even a roughly drawn triangle can give you an idea of the correct answers and be used to check your work after you use another method to solve the problem.

      <p>
        The general approach for solving particle equilibrium problems using the trigonometric method is to:
        <ol>
          <li>
						Draw and label a free-body diagram.
					</li>
          <li>
						Rearrange the forces into a force triangle and label it.
					</li>
          <li>
						Identify the knowns and unknowns.
					</li>
          <li>
						Use trigonometry to find the unknown sides or angles of the triangle.
					</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
				There must be no more than two unknowns to use this method, which may be either magnitudes or directions.
				During the problem setup, you will probably need to use the geometry of the situation to find one or more angles.
			</p>
      <p>
				If the force triangle has a right angle you can use <xref ref="soh-coh-toa"/> to find the unknown values, but in most cases, the triangle will be oblique and you will need to use either or both of the <xref ref="los" text="title"/> or the <xref ref="loc" text="title"/> to find the sides or angles.

				You are undoubtedly familiar with utility poles, which carry electric, cable and telephone lines, but have you ever noticed as you drive down a winding road that the poles will switch from one side of the road to the other and back again? Why is this?
			</p>
      <p>
        If you consider the forces acting on the top of a pole beside a curving section of road you'll observe that the tensions of the cables produce a net force towards the road.
				This force is typically opposed by a
        <lq/>
        guy wire
        <rq/>
        pulling in the opposite direction which prevents the pole from tipping over due to unbalanced forces.

									A utility pole isn't two-dimensional, but we can solve this problem as if it was by first considering the force components acting in a horizontal plane, and then considering the components in a vertical plane.
								</p>
                <p>
									It also isn't a concurrent force problem because the lines of action of the forces don't all intersect at a single point.
									However, we can make it into one by replacing the forces of the three power lines in each direction with a single force three times larger.
									This is an example of an <em>equivalent transformation</em>, a trick engineers use frequently to turn complex situations into simpler ones.
									It works here because all the tensions are equal, and the outside wires are equidistant from the center wire.
									You must be careful to justify all equivalent transformations because they will lead to errors if they are not applied correctly.
									Equivalent transformations will be discussed in greater detail in <xref ref="equivalent-tranformations"/> later.

									Since the rod is frictionless, it cannot prevent the slider from moving vertically.
									Consequently, the slider will only be in equilibrium if the resultant of the three load forces is horizontal.

									This is a single equation with a single unknown, although it is not particularly easy to solve with algebra.
									One approach is described at <url href="https://socratic.org/questions/59e5f259b72cff6c4402a6a5" visual="socratic.org/questions/59e5f259b72cff6c4402a6a5">socratic.org</url>.
									An alternate approach is to use technology to graph the function <m>y(x) = 2 + 2 \sin x - 3 \cos x</m>.
									The roots of this equation correspond to values of <m>\alpha</m> which satisfy the equilibrium condition above.
									The root occurring closest to <m>x=0</m> will be the answer corresponding to our problem, in this case <m>\alpha = 22.62°</m> which you can verify by plugging it back into the equilibrium equation.

    <title>3D Particle Equilibrium</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
			The world we live in has three dimensions.
			One and two-dimensional textbook problems have been useful for learning the principles of engineering mechanics, but to model real-world problems we will have to consider all three.
		</p>
      <p>
			Fortunately, all the principles you have learned so far still apply, but many students have difficulty visualizing three-dimensional problems drawn on two-dimensional paper and the mathematics becomes a bit harder.
			It is especially important to have good diagrams and keep your work neat and organized to avoid errors.
		</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_03-three-dimensional-coordinate-frame">
      <title>Three-Dimensional Coordinate Frame</title>
      <p>
			We need a coordinate frame for three dimensions, just as we did in two dimensions, so we add a third orthogonal axis <m>z</m> to our existing two-dimensional frame.
		</p>
      <p>
        For equilibrium of a particle, usually the origin of the coordinate frame is at the particle, the <m>x</m> axis is horizontal, and the <m>y</m> axis is vertical just as in a two-dimensional situation.
			The orientation of the <m>z</m> axis is determined by the <term>right-hand rule</term>.
			Using your <em>right hand</em>, put your palm at the origin and point your fingers along the positive <m>x</m> axis.
			Then curl your fingers towards the positive <m>y</m> axis.
			Your thumb will point in the direction of the positive <m>z</m> axis.
			For example, in the plane of the page with the positive <m>x</m> axis horizontal and to the right and the positive <m>y</m> axis vertical and upwards, the positive <m>z</m> axis will point <em>towards</em> you out of the page.
			Remember that the three axes are mutually perpendicular,
        <ie/>
        each axis is perpendicular to both of the others.
			The right-hand rule is important in many aspects of engineering, so make sure that you understand how it works.
			Mistakes will lead to sign errors.

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_03-free-body-diagrams">
      <title>Free-Body Diagrams</title>
      <p>
			As we did before, we begin our analysis by drawing a free-body diagram that shows all forces and moments acting on the object of interest.
			Drawing a <acro>FBD</acro> in three dimensions can be difficult.
			It is sometimes hard to see things in three dimensions when they are drawn on a two-dimensional sheet.
			Consequently, it is important to carefully label vectors and angles, but not to clutter up the diagram with too much and/or unnecessary information.
			When working in two dimensions, you only need one angle to determine the direction of the vector, but when working in three dimensions you need two or three angles.
		</p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_03-angles">
      <title>Angles</title>
      <p>
			As stated above, when working in three dimensions you need three angles to determine the direction of the vector, namely, the angle with respect to the <m>x</m> axis, the angle with respect to the <m>y</m> axis and the angle with respect to the <m>z</m> axis.
			The three angles mentioned above are not necessarily located in any of the coordinate planes.
			Think of it this way <mdash/> three points determine a plane, and in this case, the three points are: the origin, the tip of the vector, and a point on an axis.
			The plane made by those three points is not necessarily the <m>xy</m>, <m>yz</m>, or <m>xz</m> plane.
			It is most likely a <q>tilted</q> plane.
		</p>
      <p>
			As you learned in <xref ref="Chapter_02-direction-cosine-angles"/>, one way to quantify the direction of a vector is with direction cosine angles.
			These direction cosine angles are measured from the positive x, y, and z axes and are often labeled <m>θ_x</m>, <m>θ_y</m>, and <m>θ_z</m>, respectively.
		</p>
      <p>
			As with two dimensions, angles can be determined from geometry <mdash/> a distance vector going in the same direction as the force vector.
			This is the three-dimensional equivalent of similar triangles that you used in the two-dimensional problems.
		</p>
      <figure>
        <caption> Direction Cosine Angles </caption>
        <xi:include href="interactives.ptx" xpointer="ggb_3d-direction-angles_interactive"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
			If you know that the line of action of a force vector goes between two points, then you can use the distance vector that goes from one point to the other to determine the angles.
		</p>
      <p>
			Let's suppose that the line of action goes through two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, and the direction of the force is from <m>A</m> towards <m>B</m>.
			The first step in determining the three angles is to write the distance vector from point <m>A</m> towards point <m>B</m>.
			Let's call this vector <m>\vec{r}_{AB}</m>.
			Starting at point <m>A</m>, you need to determine how to get to point <m>B</m> by moving in each of the three directions.
			Ask yourself: to get from point <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m> do I have to move in the <m>x</m> direction? If so, how far do I have to travel? This becomes the <m>x</m> component of the vector <m>\vec{r}_{AB}</m> namely <m>r_{AB_x}</m>.
			Next, to get from point <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m> how far do I move in <m>y</m> direction? This distance is <m>r_{AB_y}</m>.
			Finally, to get from point A to point B how far do I move in the z-direction? This distance is <m>r_{AB_z}</m>.
		</p>
      <p>
			When writing these scalar components pay attention to which way you move along the axes.
			If you travel toward the positive end of an axis, the corresponding scalar component gets a positive sign.
			Travel towards the negative end results in a negative sign.
			The sign is important.
		</p>
      <p>
			Once you have determined the components of the distance vector <m>r_{AB}</m>, you can determine the total distance from point <m>A</m> to <m>B</m> using the <xref ref="distance_formula_3d" text="custom">three-dimensional Pythagorean Theorem</xref><men xml:id="pythag-3d">{r_{AB}}= \sqrt{(r_{AB_x})^2 + (r_{AB_y})^2 +(r_{AB_z})^2}
			</men></p>
      <p>
        Lastly, the angles are determined by the direction cosines, namely
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \cos \theta_x \amp = \dfrac{r_{AB_x}}{r_{AB}} \amp \cos \theta_y \amp = \dfrac{r_{AB_y}}{r_{AB}} \amp \cos \theta_z \amp = \dfrac{r_{AB_z}}{r_{AB}}
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the force vector has the same line of action as the distance vector, by the three-dimensional version of similar triangles,
        <md>
          <mrow>
            \dfrac{r_{AB_x}}{r_{AB}} \amp = \dfrac{F_x}{F} \amp \dfrac{r_{AB_y}}{r_{AB}} \amp = \dfrac{F_y}{F} \amp \dfrac{r_{AB_z}}{r_{AB}} \amp = \dfrac{F_z}{F}
          </mrow>
        </md>
        .
			So,
        <md>
          <mrow>
            F_x \amp = \left(\dfrac{r_{AB_x}}{r_{AB}}\right) F \amp F_y \amp = \left(\dfrac{r_{AB_y}}{r_{AB}}\right) F \amp F_z \amp = \left(\dfrac{r_{AB_z}}{r_{AB}}\right) F 
          </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, that is a bit of math there, but the important things to remember are:
        <ul>
          <li>
					You can use three angles to determine the direction of a force in three dimensions.
				</li>
          <li>
					You can use the geometry to get them from a distance vector that lies along the line of action of the force.
				</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
			The three direction cosine angles are not mutually independent.
			From <xref ref="pythag-3d"/> you can easily show that
			<men>
				\cos \theta_x^2 + \cos \theta_y^2 + \cos \theta_z^2 = 1
			</men>,
			so if you know two direction cosine angles you can find the third from this relationship.

      <title>General Procedure</title>
      <p>
			The general procedure for solving three-dimensional particle equilibrium is essentially the same as for two-dimensional particle equilibrium using the components method.
			The major differences are that you must carefully find each vector component using the techniques from <xref ref="coordinates-3d"/>.
			The process follows the same five-step method for creating a free-body diagram, followed by steps to solve your equilibrium equations.
		</p>
      <p><alert>Draw a Free-body Diagram:</alert></p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Select and isolate the particle.</em> The <q>free-body</q> in free-body diagram means that a concurrent force particle or connection must be isolated from the supports that are physically holding it in place.
					This means creating a separate free-body diagram from your problem sketch.
				</li>
          <li><em>Establish a coordinate system.</em> Draw a right-handed coordinate system to use as a reference for your equilibrium equations.
					Look ahead and select a coordinate system that minimizes the number of force components.
					This will simplify your vector algebra.
					The choice is technically arbitrary, but a good choice will simplify your calculations and reduce your effort.
				</li>
          <li><em>Identify all loads.</em> Add force vectors to your free-body diagram representing each applied load pushing or pulling the body, in addition to the body's weight, if it is non-negligible.
					If a force vector has a known direction, draw it.
					If its direction is unknown, assume one, and your later algebra will check your assumption.
					Every vector should have a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead indicating its direction.
				</li>
          <li><em>Identify all reactions.</em> Reactions represent the resistance of the physical supports you cut away by isolating the body in step 1.
					All particle supports are some type of two-force members with tension or compression reaction forces.
					These reactions will all be concurrent with the body loads from Step 2.
					Label each reaction with a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead.
					Again, if a vector's direction is unknown, just assume one.
				</li>
          <li><em>Label the diagram.</em> Verify that every dimension, angle, force, and moment is labeled with either a value or a symbolic name if the value is unknown.
					In our eyes, dimensioning is optional.
					Having the information needed for your calculations is helpful, but don't clutter the diagram up with unneeded details.
					Your final free-body diagram should be a stand-alone presentation and is the basis of your equilibrium equations.
				</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p><alert>Create and Solve Equilibrium Equations</alert></p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Break vectors into components.</em> Compute each force's <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> components using the tools outlined in <xref ref="coordinates-3d"/>.
					While the components in two-dimensional problems can often be found with right triangle trigonometry, three-dimensional problems often use unit vectors.
				</li>
          <li><em>Write equilibrium equations.</em> Now represent your free-body diagram as equilibrium equations.
					For a three-dimensional particle equilibrium problem, you can have up to three force equilibrium equations corresponding to a force balance in the three independent <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> directions.
					Each equation should start with the governing equation, like <m>\Sigma F_x=0</m>.
				</li>
          <li><em>Count knowns and unknowns.</em> At this point, you should have at most three unknowns remaining.
					If you have over three, reread the problem and look for overlooked information.
				</li>
          <li><em>Solve for unknowns.</em> Use algebra to simplify the equilibrium equations and solve for unknowns.
					With multiple unknowns scattered across multiple equations, linear algebra may be more efficient than substitution.
					Assume that all answers have units - unless you prove that they don't.
					Finally, underline or box your answers.
				</li>
          <li><em>Check your work.</em> If you add the components of the forces, do they add to zero? Do the results seem reasonable given the situation? Have you included appropriate units?
				</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

            We will first find unit vectors in the directions of the four forces by inspection of the free-body diagram.
				This step requires visualizing the component's unit vectors and determining the angles each makes with the coordinate axis.

				These can be solved by any method you choose.
				Here we will use Sage.
				Evaluating the coefficients and expressing the equations in matrix form gives
