<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Two-dimensional Reactions.</span></h3> <div class="para">Supports supply reaction forces and moment which prevent bodies from moving when loaded. In the most basic terms, forces prevent translation, and moments prevent rotation.</div> <div class="para">The reactions supplied by a support depend on the nature of the particular support. For example in a top view, a door hinge allows the door to rotate freely but prevents it from translating. We model this as a frictionless pin that supplies a perpendicular pair of reaction forces, but no reaction moment. We can evaluate all the other physical supports in a similar way to come up with the table below. You will notice that some two-dimensional supports only restrain one degree of freedom and others restrain up to three degrees of freedom. The number of degrees of freedom directly correlates to the number of unknowns created by the support.</div> <div class="para">The table below shows typical two-dimensional support methods and the corresponding reaction forces and moments supplied each.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/Reactions-2D.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="The table shows different supports and the corresponding number of unknown reactions. Normal supports (one unknown): force perpendicular to the surface. These supports include smooth surface, roller, rocker, pinned collar on a smooth rod, smooth pin in roller or slot. Two-force member supports (one unknown): tension or compression force in line with the two force member. These supports include a cable, a weightless link, or a spring with force F = k*delta (linear spring constant multiplied by the change in length from unstretched). Pin support (two unknowns): Two rectangular force components or one force at an unknown angle).This support is generally is a frictionless pin or hinge. Rough surface support (two unknowns): friction and normal forces or magnitude and direction of resultant force. This support type is a body contacting a rough surface. Fixed collar support (two unknowns): normal force and couple moment. This collar slides but cannot rotate. Fixed support (three unknowns): two rectangular force components and couple. This support is generally welded, bolted, or otherwise anchored."></div>
