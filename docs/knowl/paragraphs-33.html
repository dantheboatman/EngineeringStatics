<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Two-force Members.</span></h3> <div class="para">Many structures contain at least one two-force member, and trusses consist of two-force members exclusively. Recall from <a href="CH03-1d-particles.html#two-force-bodies" class="internal" title="Subsection 3.3.3: Two-force Bodies">SubsectionÂ 3.3.3</a> that a two-force body is an object subjected to exactly two forces. Two-force members are not required to be slender or straight, but can be recognized because they connect to other bodies or supports at exactly two points, and have no other loading unless it is also applied at those points.</div> <div class="para">Identifying two-force members is helpful when solving structures because they automatically establish the line of action of the two forces. In order for a two-force body to be in equilibrium, the forces acting on it must be equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and have a line-of-action passing through the point where the two forces are applied. Since these points are known, the direction of the line-of-action is readily found.</div> <div class="para">The common way to express the force of a two-force member is with a magnitude and a sense, where the sense is either tension or compression. If the two forces tend to stretch the object we say it is in <em class="emphasis">tension</em>; if they act the other way and squash the object, it is in <em class="emphasis">compression</em>. The usual approach is to assume that a two-force member is in tension, then draw the free-body diagram and write the equilibrium equations accordingly. If the analysis shows that the forces are negative then they actually act with the opposite sense, i.e. compression.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/images/tension-compression.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="A horizontal two-force member with forces pointing away from each other (tension) and a second with forces pointing towards each other (compression)."></div>
