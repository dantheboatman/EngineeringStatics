<div class="para">This law, also sometimes called the “law of inertia,” tells us that bodies maintain their current velocity unless a net force is applied to change it. In other words, an object at rest it will remain at rest and a moving object will hold its current speed and direction unless an unbalanced force causes a velocity change. Remember that velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction, so an unbalanced force may cause an object to speed up, slow down, or change direction.</div>
