<span class="process-math">\(dA\)</span> is just an area, but an extremely tiny one!</div> <div class="para">It’s an example of an <dfn class="terminology">differential quantity</dfn> — <dfn class="terminology"></dfn>also called an <dfn class="terminology">infinitesimal</dfn>. A differential quantity is a value which is as close to zero as it can possibly be without actually being zero. You can think of its value as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{\infty}\text{.}\)</span> Integration is the process of adding up an infinite number of infinitesimal quantities.</div> <div class="para">Some other differential quantities we will see in statics are <span class="process-math">\(dx\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(dy\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dz\text{,}\)</span> which are infinitesimal increments of distance; <span class="process-math">\(dV\text{,}\)</span> which is a differential volume; <span class="process-math">\(dW\text{,}\)</span> a differential weight; <span class="process-math">\(dm\text{,}\)</span> a differential mass, and so on.</div> <div class="para">Any product involving a differential quantity is itself a differential quantity, so if the area of a vertical strip is given by <span class="process-math">\(dA =y\ dx\)</span> then, even though height <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is a real number, the area is a differential because <span class="process-math">\(dx\)</span> is differential.</div> <div class="para">If you like, you can pronounce the <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> as “the little bit of” so <span class="process-math">\(dA = y\ dx\)</span> reads “The little bit of area is the height <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> times a little bit x.” and <span class="process-math">\(A = \int dA\)</span> reads “The total area is the sum of the little bits of area.”</div></article></body>
