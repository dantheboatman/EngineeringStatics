<div class="para">The ways to think about forces, moments and equilibrium, and the mathematics used to manipulate them are like tools in your toolbox. Solving statics problems requires acquiring, choosing, and using these tools. Some problems can be solved with a single tool, while others require multiple tools. Sometimes one tool is a better choice, sometimes another. You need familiarity and practice to get skilled using your tools. As your skills and understanding improve, it gets easier to recognize the most efficient way to get a job done.</div>
