<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Finding a cross product is a vector operation where you feed the cross product two vectors and it gives you a vector answer that is perpendicular to both vectors you crossed. The mathematics of cross products were discussed in <a href="cross-product-math.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 2.4.5: Cross Products">Cross Products</a> where the basic equation was given as <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cross-product-def.html" title="Equation 2.21">(2.21)</a> where \(\theta\) is the angle between the two vectors as shown in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ggb_xnakpuqq.html" title="Figure 4.4">Figure 4.4</a> above, and \(\hat{\vec{u}}\) is the unit vector perpendicular to both \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\)  with the direction coming from the right-hand rule.</p>
