<div class="para">The interactive below demonstrates the method of sections. The internal forces in the truss members are exposed by cutting through the truss at three locations. The known loads are shown in red, and the unknown reactions <span class="process-math">\(F_x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A_y\text{,}\)</span> and unknown member forces are shown in blue. All members are assumed to be in tension. In this situation, it is not necessary to find the reactions if the section to the right of the cut is selected.</div>
