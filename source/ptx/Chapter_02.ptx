  <title>Forces and Other Vectors</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Before you can solve statics problems, you will need to understand the basic physical
      quantities used in Statics: scalars and vectors. </p>
    <p><term>Scalars</term> are physical quantities that have no associated direction and can be
      described by a positive or negative number, or even zero. Scalar quantities follow the usual
      laws of algebra, and most scalar quantities have units. Mass, time, temperature, and length
      are all scalars. </p>
    <p><term>Vectors</term> represent physical quantities which have magnitude and a direction.
      Vectors are identified by a symbolic name which will be typeset in bold like <m>\vec{r}</m> or
      <m>\vec{F}</m> to indicate its vector nature. The primary vector quantity you will encounter
      in statics will be <term>force</term>, but <term>moment</term> and <term>position</term> are
      also important vectors. Computations involving vectors must always consider the directionality
      of each term and follow the rules of vector algebra as described in this chapter. </p>

      <p>You can visualize a vector as an <term>arrow</term> pointing in a particular direction. The
        <term>tip</term> is the pointed end and the <term>tail</term> the trailing end. The tip and
        tail of a vector define a <term>line of action</term>. A line of action can be thought of as
        an invisible string along which a vector can slide. Sliding a vector along its line of
        action does not change its magnitude or its direction. Sliding a vector can be a handy way
        to simplify vector problems. </p>

    <p>The standard notation for a vector uses either an arrow or bar above the vector’s name or the
      vector’s name in bold font. All three of these notations mean the same thing.
      <me>\vecarrow{F} = \bar{F} = \vec{F} = \textrm{ a vector named } F</me>
       Most printed works including this book will use the bold symbol for vectors, but for
      handwritten work, you and your instructor will use the bar or arrow notation. </p>
    <p>Force vectors acting on physical objects have a <term>point of application</term>, which is
      the point at which the force is applied. Other vectors, such as moment vectors, are <term>free
      vectors</term>, which means that the point of application is not significant. Free vectors can
      be moved freely to any location as long as the magnitude and direction are maintained.</p>
    <p>The vector’s <term>magnitude</term> is a <em>positive real number</em> including units which
      describes the <sq>strength</sq> or <sq>intensity</sq> of the vector. Graphically a vector’s
      magnitude is represented by the length of its vector arrow, and symbolically by enclosing the
      vector’s symbol with vertical bars. This is the same notation as for the absolute value of a
      number. The absolute value of a number and the magnitude of a vector can both be thought of as
      a distance from the origin, so the notation is appropriate. By convention the magnitude of a
      vector is also indicated, by the same letter as the vector, but in non-bold font.
      <me> F = |\vec{F}| = \textrm{ the magnitude of vector }\vec{F}</me>
    </p>
    <p>By itself, a vector’s magnitude is a scalar quantity, but it makes no sense to speak of a
      vector with a negative magnitude so vector magnitudes are always positive or zero. Multiplying
      a vector by -1 produces a vector with the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite
      direction.</p>
    <p>Vector directions are described with respect to a <term>coordinate system</term>. A
      coordinate system is an arbitrary reference system used to establish the <term>origin</term>
      and the primary directions. Distances are usually measured from the origin, and directions
      from a primary or <term>reference direction</term>. You are probably familiar with the
      Cartesian coordinate system with mutually perpendicular <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axes
      and the origin at their intersection point.</p>
    <p>Another way of describing a vector’s direction is to specify its <term>orientation</term> and
      <term>sense</term>. Orientation is the angle the vector’s line of action makes with a
      specified reference direction, and sense defines the direction the vector points along its
      line of action. A vector with a positive sense points towards the positive end of the
      reference axis and vice-versa. A vector representing an object’s weight has a vertical
      reference direction and a downward sense or negative sense, for example. </p>
    <p>A third way to represent a vector is with its <term>unit vector</term> multiplied by a scalar
      value called its <term>scalar component</term>. A unit vector is a vector with a length of
      <em>one</em> (unitless) which points in a defined direction. Hence, a unit vector represents
      pure direction, independent of the magnitude and unit of measurement. <term> The scalar
      component is a signed number</term> with units that may be positive or negative, and which
      defines both the magnitude and sense of the vector. They should not be confused with vector
      magnitudes, which are always positive.</p>
    <p>Vectors are either constant or vary as a function of time, position, or something else. For
      example, if a force varied with time according to the function <m>F(t) = 10t</m> [N] where
      <m>t</m> is the time in seconds, then the force would be <m>\N{0}</m> at <m>t=0</m>, and
      increase by <m>\N{10}</m> each second thereafter. </p>

    <introduction>
      <p>The simplest vector calculations involve one-dimensional vectors. You can learn some
        important terminology here without much mathematical difficulty. In one-dimensional
        situations, all vectors share the same line of action, but may point towards either end. If
        the line of action has a positive end like a coordinate axis does, then a vector pointing
        towards that end will have a positive scalar component.</p>

      <title>Vector Addition </title>
      <p>Adding multiple vectors together finds the <term>resultant</term> vector. Resultant vectors
        can be thought of as the <em>sum</em> of or <em>combination</em> of two or more vectors. </p>
      <p>To find the resultant vector <m>\vec{R}</m> of two one-dimensional vectors <m>\vec{A}</m>
        and <m> \vec{B}</m> you can use the tip-to-tail technique in <xref
        ref="fig-ggb-1d-definitions"/> below. In the tip-to-tail technique, you slide vector
        <m>\vec{B}</m> until its tail is at the tip of <m>\vec{A}</m>, and the vector from the tail
        of <m>\vec{A}</m> to the tip of <m>\vec{B}</m> is the resultant <m>\vec{R}</m>. Note that
        the resultant <m>\vec{R}</m> is the same when you add <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m>, so
        the order of vector addition does not matter and is considered commutative.</p>

      <p>The easiest way to handle vector subtraction is to add the negative of the vector you are

        after flipping the vector you are subtracting.

      <title>Vector Multiplication by a Scalar</title>
      <p>Multiplying or dividing a vector by a scalar changes the vector’s magnitude but maintains
        its original line of action. One common transformation is to find the negative of a vector.
        To find the negative of vector <m>\vec{A}</m>, we multiply it by -1; in equation form

      <p>Spatially, the effect of negating a vector this way is to rotate it by 180°. The magnitude,

        <li>Why are orthogonal coordinate systems useful?</li>
        <li>How do you transform between polar and Cartesian coordinates?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <introduction>
      <p>A coordinate system gives us a frame of reference to describe a system that we would like
        to analyze. In statics we normally use <term>orthogonal</term> coordinate systems, where
        orthogonal means <q>perpendicular.</q> In an orthogonal coordinate system the coordinate
        direction are perpendicular to each other and thereby independent. The intersection of the
        coordinate axes is called the <term>origin</term>, and measurements are made from there.
        Both points and vectors are described with a set of numbers called the
        <term>coordinates</term>. For points in space, the coordinates specify the distance you must
        travel in each of the coordinate directions to get from the origin to the point in question.
        Together, the coordinates can be thought of as specifying a <term>position vector</term>, a
        vector from the origin directly to the point. The position vector gives the magnitude and
        direction needed to travel directly from the origin to the point.</p>
      <p>In the case of force vectors, the coordinates are the <term>scalar components</term> of the
        force in each of the coordinate directions. These components locate the tip of the vector
        and they can be interpreted as the fraction of the total force which acts in each of the
        coordinate directions.</p>
      <p>Three coordinate directions are needed to map our real three-dimensional world but in this
        section we will start with two, simpler, two-dimensional orthogonal systems:
        <term>rectangular</term> and <term>polar</term> coordinates<term>,</term> and the tools to
        convert from one to the other.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="rectangular-coords">
      <title>Rectangular Coordinates</title>
      <p>The most important coordinate system is the <term>Cartesian</term> system, which was named
        after the French mathematician René Descartes. In two dimensions the coordinate axes are
        straight lines rotated 90° apart named <m>x</m>, and <m>y</m>. </p>

          <p>In most cases, the <m>x</m> axis is horizontal and points to the right, and the
            <m>y</m> axis points vertically upward, however, we are free to rotate or translate this
            entire coordinate system if we like. It is usually mathematically advantageous to
            establish the origin at a convenient point to make measurements from, and to align one
            of the coordinate axes with a major feature of the problem.</p>

          <p>You must be careful here and use some common sense. The <m>\ang{-30}</m> angle your
            calculator gives you in this problem is incorrect because point <m>P</m> is in the
            second quadrant, but your calculator doesn't know this. It can't tell whether the
            argument of <m> \tan^{-1}(-0.577)</m> is negative because the <m>x</m> was negative or
            because the <m>y</m> was negative, so it must make an assumption and in this case it is
            wrong. </p>
          <p>The arctan function on calculators will always return values in the first and fourth
            quadrant. If, by inspection of the <m>x</m> and the <m>y</m> coordinates, you see that

              <description>The Force vector F has a magnitude of 200 N. It is shown on a circle that
                is evenly divided into 12 segments (slices) radially (i.e., each segment is 30
                degrees, where the positive x-axis is the beginning of the first segment and +30
                degrees is the end of the first segment). The Force falls at the end of the 7th
                segment (i.e. in quadrant III).</description>

        <solution>
          <p> Given: The magnitude of force <m>\vec{F} = \N{200}</m>, and from the diagram we see
            that the direction of <m>\vec{F}</m> is <m>\ang{30}</m> counter-clockwise from the
            negative <m>x</m> axis.</p>
          <p>Letting <m>\theta = \ang{30}</m> we can find the components of <m>\vec{F}</m> with
            right triangle trigonometry.</p>

            </md>
          </p>
          <p>Since the force points down and to the left into the third quadrant, these values are
            actually negative, and the signs must be applied manually. </p>
          <p> After making this adjustment, the location of <m>\vec{F}</m> expressed in rectangular
            coordinates is:
            <me>\vec{F} = \langle \N{-173.2}, \N{-100} \rangle </me>
          </p>
        </solution>
        <solution>
          <p>If you would prefer not to apply the negative signs by hand, you can convert the
            <m>\ang{30}</m> to an angle measured from the positive <m>x</m> axis and let your
            calculator takes care of the signs. You may use either <m>\theta = \ang{30} \pm
            \ang{180}</m>.</p>

          <p>Although this approach is mathematically correct, experience has shown that it can lead
            to errors and we recommend that when you work with right triangles, use angles between
            zero and <m>\ang{90}</m>, and apply signs manually as required by the physical
            situation.</p>

    <introduction>
      <p>In this section we will discuss four methods to specify points and vectors in
        three-dimensional space.</p>
      <p>The most commonly used method is an extension of two-dimensional <term>rectangular
        coordinates</term> to three-dimensions. Alternately, points and vectors in three dimensions
        can be specified in terms of <term>direction cosines</term>, or using <term>spherical</term>
        or cylindrical coordinate systems. These will be discussed in the following sections.</p>
      <p>You will often need to convert from one representation to another. Good visualization
        skills are helpful here.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-rectangular-coordinates">
      <title>Rectangular Coordinates</title>
      <p>We can extend the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system into three dimensions easily
        by adding a <m>z</m> axis perpendicular to the two-dimensional Cartesian plane. The notation
        is similar to the notation used for two-dimensional vectors. Points and forces are expressed
        as ordered triples of rectangular coordinates following the same notation used
        previously.</p>

      </p>
      <p>For nearly all three-dimensional problems, you will need the rectangular <m>x</m>,
        <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> locations of points in space and components of vectors before
        proceeding with the computations. If you are given the components upfront, then you are set
        to move forward, but otherwise, you will need to transform one coordinate system into
        rectangular coordinates.</p>

            <p>In one sense, it doesn't matter at all. The positive directions of the coordinate
              axes are arbitrary. On the other hand, it’s convenient for everyone if we can agree on
              a standard orientation. In mathematics and engineering, the default is a
              <term>right-handed coordinate system</term>, where the coordinate axes are oriented

      <title>Direction Cosine Angles</title>
      <p>The direction of a vector in two-dimensional systems could be expressed clearly with a
        single angle measured from a reference axis, but adding an additional dimension means that
        one angle is no longer enough. </p>
      <p>One way to define the direction of a three-dimensional vector is by using <term>direction
        cosine angles</term>, also commonly known as <term>coordinate direction angles</term>. The
        direction cosine angles are the angles between the positive <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>
        axes to a given vector and are traditionally named <m>\theta_x</m>, <m>\theta_y</m>, and
        <m>\theta_z</m>. Three-dimensional vectors, components, and angles are often difficult to
        visualize because they do not commonly lie in the Cartesian planes. </p>

      <p>We can relate the components of a vector to its direction cosine angles using the following
        equations. <mdn>
        <mrow xml:id="direction-cosines">\cos {\theta_x} \amp = \frac{A_x}{\left |A \right |} \amp
          \cos \theta_y \amp = \frac {A_y}{\left |A \right |} \amp \cos \theta_z \amp = \frac
          {A_z}{\left |A \right |}</mrow>
        </mdn> </p>
      <p>Note the component in the numerator of each direction cosine equation is positive or
        negative as defined by the coordinate system, and the vector magnitude in the denominator is
        always positive. From these equations, we can conclude that:
        <ul>
        <li>Direction cosines are signed value between -1 and 1.</li>
        <li>Direction cosine angles must always be between <m>\ang{0}</m> and <m>\ang{180}</m> or
          <me>\ang{0} \le \theta_n \le \ang{180}.</me>
        </li>
        <li>Any direction cosine angle greater than <m>\ang{90}</m> indicates a negative component
          along that respective axis. Spatially this is because all direction cosine angles are
          measured from the positive side of each axis. Mathematically this is because the cosine of
          any angle between 90 and 180 degrees is numerically negative.</li>

        <ul>
        <li>The signs of unit vector components need to match the signs of the original position
          vector. A unit vector has the same line of action and sense as the position vector but is
          scaled down to one unit in magnitude.</li>
        <li>Components of a unit vector must be between -1 and 1. If the magnitude of a unit vector

      <p>If you look closely at the right side of equation <xref ref="direction-cosines"/>, you will
        see that each equation consists of a component divided by the total vector magnitude. These
        are the same equations just used to find unit vectors. Thus, the cosine of each direction

        added together are called the <term>components</term>, and the sum of the components is
        called the <term>resultant vector</term>.</p>
      <p>These different methods are tools for your statics toolbox. They give you multiple
        different ways to think about vector addition and to approach a problem. Your goal should be
        to learn to use them all and to identify which approach will be the easiest to use in a
        given situation.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-triangle-rule-of-vector-addition">
      <title>Triangle Rule of Vector Addition</title>
      <p>All methods of vector addition are ultimately based on the tip-to-tail method discussed in
        a one-dimensional context in <xref ref="one-dimensional-vector-addition"/>. There are two
        ways to draw or visualize adding vectors in two or three dimensions, the <term>Triangle
        Rule</term> and <term>Parallelogram Rule</term>. Both are equivalent.

        <li><title>Parallelogram Rule</title><p>Place both vectors' tails at the origin, then
          complete a parallelogram with lines parallel to each vector through the tip of the other.
          The resultant is equal to the diagonal from the tails to the opposite corner.</p></li>

      <p>The interactive below shows two forces <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> pulling on a

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-orthogonal-components">
      <title>Orthogonal Components</title>
      <p>Any arbitrary vector <m>\vec{F}</m> can broken into two component vectors which are the
        sides of a parallelogram having <m>\vec{F}</m> as its diagonal. The process of finding
        components of a vector in particular directions is called <term>vector
        resolution</term>.</p>
      <p>While a vector can be resolved into components in any two directions, it's generally most
        useful to resolve them into <term>rectangular</term> or <term>orthogonal components</term>,
        where the parallelogram is a rectangle and the sides are perpendicular. </p>
      <p>One benefit of finding orthogonal components is that each component is independent of the
        other. This independence simplifies the vector computations by allowing us to use
        independent equations for each orthogonal direction. Another benefit of components parallel
        to the coordinate axes is that you can treat these components as scalar quantities and use
        ordinary algebra to work with them.</p>
      <p>However, there are an infinite number of possible rectangles to choose from, so each vector
        has an infinite number of sets of rectangular components. Of these, the most important one
        is found when the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes.
        These particular components are given <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> subscripts indicate that the
        components are aligned with the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes. For the vector <m>\vec{F}</m>,
        <men>\vec{F} = \vec{F}_x + \vec{F}_y = F_x\ \ihat + F_y \jhat</men>
         , where <m>F_x</m> and <m>F_y</m> are the scalar components of <m>\vec{F}</m>.</p>
      <p>Another possibility is to rotate the coordinate system to any other convenient angle, and
        find the components in the directions of the rotated coordinate axes <m>x'</m> and
        <m>y'</m>. In either case, the vector is the sum of the rectangular components
        <men>\vec{F} = \vec{F}_x + \vec{F}_y = \vec{F}_{x'} + \vec{F}_{y'}</men>
         .</p>

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-graphical-vector-addition">
      <title>Graphical Vector Addition</title>
      <p>Graphical vector addition involves drawing a scaled diagram using either the parallelogram
        or triangle rule, and then measuring the magnitudes and directions from the diagram.
        Graphical solutions work well enough for two-dimensional problems where all the vectors live
        in the same plane and can be drawn on a sheet of paper, but are not very useful for
        three-dimensional problems unless you use technology. </p>
      <p>If you carefully draw the triangle accurately to scale and use a protractor and ruler you
        can measure the magnitude and direction of the resultant. However, your answer will only be
        as precise as your diagram and your ability to read your tools. If you use technology such
        as GeoGebra or a CAD program to make the diagram, your answer will be precise. The
        interactive in <xref ref="addition-2d-views"/> may be useful for this.</p>
      <p>Even though the graphical approach has limitations, it is worth your attention because it
        provides a good way to visualize the effects of multiple forces, to quickly estimate
        ballpark answers, and to visualize the diagrams you need to use alternate methods to
        follow.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-trigonometric-vector-addition">
      <title>Trigonometric Vector Addition</title>
      <p>You <em>can</em> get a precise answer from the triangle or parallelogram rule by
        <ol>
        <li>drawing a quick diagram using either rule,</li>
        <li>identifying three known sides or angles,</li>

      </p>
      <p>The trigonometric tools you will need is in <xref ref="useful-mathematics"/>.</p>
      <p>Using triangle-based geometry to solve vector problems is a quick and powerful tool, but
        includes the following limitations:
        <ul>
        <li>There are only three sides in a triangle; thus vectors can only be added two at a time.
          If you need to add three or more vectors using this method, you must add the first two,
          then add the third to that sum and so on.</li>
        <li>If you fail to draw the correct vector triangle or identify the known sides and angles,
          you will not find the correct answer. </li>
        <li>The trigonometric functions are scalar functions. They are quick ways of solving for the
          magnitudes of vectors and the angle between vectors, but you may still need to find the
          vector components from a given datum.</li>
        </ul> </p>
      <p> When you need to find the resultant of more than two vectors, it is generally best to use
        the algebraic methods described below.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-algebraic-addition-of-components">
      <title>Algebraic Addition of Components</title>
      <p>While the parallelogram rule and the graphical and trigonometric methods are useful tools
        for visualizing and finding the sum of two vectors, they are not particularly suited for
        adding <em>more</em> than two vectors or working in three dimensions.</p>
      <p>Consider vector <m>\vec{R}</m> which is the sum of several vectors <m>\vec{A}</m>,
        <m>\vec{B}</m>, <m>\vec{C}</m> and perhaps more. Vectors <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{B}</m> and
        <m>\vec{C}</m> are the components of <m>\vec{R}</m>, and the <m>\vec{R}</m> is the resultant
        of <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{B}</m> and <m>\vec{C}</m>. </p>
      <p>It is easy enough to say that <m>\vec{R} = \vec{A}+ \vec{B}+ \vec{C}</m>, but how can we
        calculate <m>\vec{R}</m> if we know the components? You could draw the vectors arranged
        tip-to-tail and then use the triangle rule to add the first two components, then use it
        again to add the third component to that sum, and so forth until all the components have
        been added. The final sum is the resultant, <m>\vec{R}</m>. The process gets progressively
        more tedious the more components there are to sum.</p>
      <p>This section introduces an alternate method to add multiple vectors which is
        straightforward, efficient and robust. This is called <em>algebraic method</em>, because the
        vector addition is replaced with a process of <em>scalar</em> addition of <em>scalar</em>
        components. The algebraic technique works equally well for two and three-dimensional
        vectors, and for summing any number of vectors.</p>
      <p>To find the sum of multiple vectors using the algebraic:
        <ol>
        <li>Find the scalar components of each component vector in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
          directions using the P to R procedure described in <xref ref="coord-transformation"
          />.</li>
        <li>Algebraically sum the scalar components in each coordinate direction. The scalar
          components will be positive if they point right or up, negative if they point left or
          down. These sums are the scalar components of the resultant.</li>
        <li>Resolve the resultant’s components to find the magnitude and direction of the resultant
          vector using the R to P procedure described in <xref ref="coord-transformation"/>.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>We can write the equation for the resultant <m>\vec{F}_R</m> as
        <me> \vec{F}_R = \sum F_x\ \ihat + \sum F_y\ \jhat + \sum F_z\ \khat </me>
         or in bracket notation

      <title>Vector Subtraction</title>
      <p>Like one-dimensional vector subtraction, the easiest way to handle two-dimensional vector
        subtraction is by taking the negative of a vector followed by vector addition. Multiplying a
        vector by -1 preserves its magnitude but flips its direction, which has the effect of
        changing the sign of the scalar components.

    <introduction>
      <p>Unlike ordinary algebra where there is only one way to multiply numbers, there are two
        distinct vector multiplication operations. The first is called the <term>dot product</term>
        or <term>scalar product</term> because the result is a scalar value, and the second is
        called the <term>cross product</term> or <term>vector product</term> and has a vector
        result. The dot product will be discussed in this section and the cross product in the
        next.</p>
      <p>For two vectors <m>\vec{A}= \langle A_x, A_y, A_z \rangle</m> and <m>\vec{B} = \langle B_x,
        B_y, B_z \rangle,</m> the dot product multiplication is computed by summing the products of
        the components.
        <men xml:id="dot-product-1"> \vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z </men>
      </p>
      <p>An alternate, equivalent method to compute the dot product is
        <men xml:id="dot-product-2">\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = | \vec{A} | | \vec{B} |\cos \theta = A\
        B\ \cos \theta </men>
         where <m>\theta</m> in the equation is the angle between the two vectors and <m>| \vec{A}
        |</m> and <m>| \vec{B} |</m> are the magnitudes of <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m>.</p>
      <p>We can conclude from this equation that the dot product of two perpendicular vectors is
        zero, because <m>\cos \ang{90} = 0</m>, and that the dot product of two parallel vectors is
        the product of their magnitudes.</p>
      <!--TODO should probably include mathematical proof for this statement and example-->
      <p>When dotting unit vectors that have a magnitude of one, the dot products of a unit vector
        with itself is one and the dot product two perpendicular unit vectors is zero, so for
        <m>\ihat</m>, <m>\jhat</m>, and <m>\khat</m> we have

    <subsection xml:id="vector-projections">
      <title>Vector Projection</title>
      <p>The dot product is used to find the <term>projection</term> of one vector onto another. You
        can think of a projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> on <m>\vec{A}</m> as a vector the length of the
        shadow of <m>\vec{B}</m> on the line of action of <m>\vec{A}</m> when the sun is directly
        above <m>\vec{A}</m>. More precisely, the projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto <m>\vec{A}</m>
        produces the rectangular component of <m>\vec{B}</m> in the direction <em>parallel</em> to
        <m>\vec{A}</m>. This is one side of a rectangle aligned with <m>\vec{A}</m>, having
        <m>\vec{B}</m> as its diagonal. </p>
      <p>This is illustrated in <xref ref="ggb_dot_product"/>, where <m>\vec{u}</m> is the
        projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto <m>\vec{A}</m>, or alternately <m>\vec{u}</m> is the
        rectangular component of <m>\vec{B}</m> in the direction of <m>\vec{A}</m>. </p>
      <p>In this text we will use the symbols
        <ul>
        <li><m>\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B}</m> to mean the vector projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> on
          <m>\vec{A}</m></li>
        <li><m>|\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B}|</m> to mean the magnitude of the projection, a positive or
          zero-valued scalar value, and</li>
        <li><m>\|\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B}\|</m> to mean the scalar component of the projection, also
          known as the <term>scalar projection</term>, which can have a positive, zero, or negative
          scalar value.</li>
        </ul> </p>
      <p>As we have mentioned before, the magnitude of a vector is its length and is always positive
        or zero, while a scalar component is a signed value that can be positive or negative. When a
        scalar component is multiplied by a unit vector the result is a vector in that direction
        when the scalar component is positive, or <m>\ang{180}</m> opposite when the scalar
        component is negative.</p>
      <figure xml:id="ggb_dot_product">
        <caption>Vector projection in two dimensions.</caption>
        <xi:include href="interactives.ptx" xpointer="ggb_2d-dot-product_interactive"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The interactive shows that the projection is the adjacent side of a right triangle with
        <m>\vec{B}</m> as the hypotenuse. From the definition of the dot product <xref
        ref="dot-product-2"/> we find that
        <me>\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} = A ( B\ \cos \theta) = A\ \|\proj_A B\|</me>
         , where <m>B\ \cos \theta</m> is the scalar component of the projection. So, the dot
        product of <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> gives us the projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto
        <m>\vec{A}</m> times the magnitude of <m>\vec{A}</m>. This value will be positive when
        <m>\theta &lt; \ang{90}</m>, negative when <m>\theta &gt; \ang{90}</m>, and zero when the
        vectors are perpendicular because of the properties of the cosine function. </p>
      <p>So, to find the scalar value of the projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto <m>\vec{A}</m> we
        divide by the magnitude of <m>\vec{A}</m>.</p>
      <p>
        <men xml:id="projection2"> \|\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B} \| =\frac{\vec{A}\cdot
        \vec{B}}{A}=\frac{\vec{A}{A}} \cdot \vec{B}=\hat{\vec{A}}\cdot \vec{B}</men>
      </p>
      <p>The final simplified form is written in terms of the unit vector in the direction vector
        <m>\hat{\vec{A}}=\dfrac{\vec{A}}{A}</m>.</p>
      <p>If you want the <em>vector</em> projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto <m>\vec{A}</m>, as
        opposed to the <em>scalar</em> projection we just found, multiply the <em>scalar</em>

        = \left (\hat{\vec{A}} \cdot \vec{B} \right )\hat{\vec{A}}</men>
      </p>
      <p>Rearranging the vectors to find the vector projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto
        <m>\vec{B}</m>, we dot the vector <m>\vec{A}</m> onto the unit vector <m>\hat{B}</m> and

      <p>The spatial interpretation of the results the scalar projection <m>\|\proj_A B\|</m> is

              force that is along (or parallel to) the anchor. If we were to simply dot the tension

      <title>Cross Product of Unit Vectors</title>
      <p>Let's begin our investigation of cross products with unit vectors. Since unit vectors have
        a magnitude of one and are perpendicular to each other, the magnitude of the cross product
        of two perpendicular unit vectors will always be a unit vector that is perpendicular to
        <em>both</em> of the original vectors with the direction determined by the <em>right-hand
        rule.</em></p>
      <p>There are two techniques to apply the right-hand rule, the three-finger technique and the
        point-and-curl method. You don't need both, but do you will need to master one or the other
        to find the direction of cross products.</p>
      <p>The three-finger right-hand rule technique relies on the basic body geometry that your
        extended index finger, middle finger, and thumb are all perpendicular to each other. If you
        can align your index finger with the first vector you are crossing and your middle finger
        with the second vector you are crossing, then your thumb will point in the direction of the
        cross-product vector. Alternately, if you align your thumb with the first vector you are
        crossing and your index finger with the second vector you are crossing, then your middle
        finger points in the direction of the cross-product vector. We prefer to use the
        index-crossed-into-middle version as it results in a thumb-direction cross product in the
        same way the point-and-curl method does below.</p>

          <description>Using the right hand, point your index finger straight out, the thumb up
            (like giving a thumbs-up), and the middle finger pointed perpendicular to the pointer
            finger and thumb. The index represents the first vector you are crossing, the middle
            finger represents the second vector you are crossing, and the thumb represents the cross
            product of the two vectors. Alternatively, the first vector can be your thumb, the
            second your index finger, and the middle finger is the direction of the cross
            product.</description>
        </image>
      </figure>
      <p>The point-and-curl right-hand rule method can also be used to find a cross product's
        direction. Start with your right hand flat and fingertips pointing along the first vector
        you are crossing with your fingertips pointing in the direction of the arrowhead. Then
        rotate your hand until the 2nd vector you are crossing is perpendicular to your fingers and
        imagine that it pushes your fingers into a curl around your thumb. In this position, your
        thumb defines the direction of the cross product. </p>

      <p>Now we can apply these techniques to unit vectors. Assuming a standard <m>x</m> axis to the
        right and <m>y</m> axis up system, let's cross <m>\ihat</m> in the <m>x</m> direction with
        <m>\jhat</m> in the <m>y</m> direction. Given what you have already learned about right-hand
        coordinate systems from Physics or <xref ref="Chapter_02-right-hand-axes"/>, you might be
        able to forecast that
        <me>\ihat\times\jhat = \khat</me>
         where <m>\khat</m> going in the positive <m>z</m> direction. The figure below demonstrates
        how you would use either three-finger or point-and-curl to find this answer.</p>

          <p>An alternate way to remember this is to use the cross-product circle shown. For example
            when you cross <m>\ihat</m> with <m>\jhat</m> you are going in the positive
            (counter-clockwise) direction around the blue inner circle and thus the answer is
            <m>+\khat</m>. But when you cross <m>\jhat</m> into <m>\ihat</m> you go in the negative
            (clockwise) direction around the circle and thus get a <m>-\khat</m>. Remember that the
            order of cross products matter. If you put the vectors in the wrong order you will
            introduce a sign error.</p>
          <p>If you have any negative unit vectors it is easiest to pull out the negatives until
            after you have taken the cross product, like the following.
            <me>-\jhat \times \ihat = (-1)\left ( \jhat \times \ihat \right )=(-1)(-\khat )=+\khat

            <description>An alternate way to remember this is to use the cross-product circle in
              this image. i is shown at the top of the circle, j is shown at the bottom left of the
              circle (120 degrees from i), and k is shown at the bottom right of the circle (120
              degrees from j). Curved blue arrows are drawn from i to j to k (counter-clockwise) and
              indicated as the positive (+) direction). An outer circle is formed by red curved
              arrows that are drawn from k to j to i (clockwise) and indicated with the negative
              direction. For example when you cross i with j you are going in the positive
              (counter-clockwise) direction around the blue inner circle and thus the answer is +k.
              But when you cross j into i you go in the negative (clockwise) direction around the
              circle and thus get a −k. Remember that the order of cross products matters. If you
              put the vectors in the wrong order, you will introduce a sign error. </description>

      <title>Cross Product of Arbitrary Vectors</title>
      <p>The cross product of two three-dimensional vectors can be calculated by evaluating the
        <em>determinant</em> of this <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix.
        <men xml:id="cross-product-1"> \vec{A} \times \vec{B} = \begin{vmatrix} \ihat \amp \jhat
        \amp \khat \\ A_x \amp A_y \amp A_z \\ B_x \amp B_y \amp B_z \end{vmatrix} </men>
      </p>
      <p>Here, the first row contains the unit vectors, the second row contains the components of
        <m>\vec{A}</m>, and the third row, the components of <m>\vec{B}</m>. </p>
      <p>Calculating the <m>3 \times 3</m> determinant can be reduced to calculating three <m>2
        \times 2</m> determinants using the method of cofactors, as follows
        <men>\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = +\begin{vmatrix} A_y \amp A_z \\ B_y \amp B_z \end{vmatrix}
        \ihat -\begin{vmatrix} A_x \amp A_z \\ B_x \amp B_z \end{vmatrix} \jhat +\begin{vmatrix} A_x
        \amp A_y \\ B_x \amp B_y \end{vmatrix} \khat </men>
      </p>
      <p>Finally a <m>2 \times 2</m> determinant can be evaluated with the formula
        <men> \begin{vmatrix} a \amp b \\ c \amp d\end{vmatrix} = a d - b c</men>
      </p>
      <p>After simplifying, the resulting formula for a three-dimensional cross product is
        <men xml:id="cross-product-2">\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = (A_y B_z - A_z B_y) \ihat - ( A_x B_z
        - A_z B_x) \jhat + (A_x B_y - A_y B_x)\khat</men>
      </p>
      <p>In practice, the easiest way to remember this equation is to use the augmented determinant
        below, where the first two columns have been copied and placed after the determinant. The
        cross product is then calculated by adding the product of the red diagonals and subtracting
        the product of blue diagonals. </p>

      <p> The result is

         , which is mathematically equivalent to equation <xref ref="cross-product-2"/>.</p>
      <p>In two dimensions, vectors <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> have no <m>z</m> components,
        so <xref ref="cross-product-1"/> reduces to
