  <title>Introduction to Statics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Engineering Statics is the gateway into <em>engineering mechanics</em>, which is the application of Newtonian physics to design and analyze objects, systems, and structures with respect to motion, deformation, and failure. In addition to learning the subject itself, you will also develop skills in the art and practice of problem solving and mathematical modeling, skills that will benefit you throughout your engineering career.</p>
    <p>The subject is called <q>statics</q> because it is concerned with particles and rigid bodies that are in equilibrium, and these will usually be stationary, <ie/> static. </p>
    <p>The chapters in this book are:
<ul marker=""><li><xref ref="Chapter_01" text="title"/><mdash/>   an overview of statics and an introduction to units and problem solving.</li><li><xref ref="Chapter_02" text="title"/><mdash/>  basic principles and mathematical operations on force and position vectors. </li><li><xref ref="Chapter_03" text="title"/><mdash/>   an introduction to equilibrium and problem solving.</li><li><xref ref="Chapter_04" text="title"/><mdash/>  the rotational tendency of forces, and simplification of force systems.</li><li><xref ref="Chapter_05" text="title"/><mdash/>   balance of forces and moments for single rigid bodies.</li><li><xref ref="Chapter_06" text="title"/><mdash/>   balance of forces and moments on interconnected systems of rigid bodies.</li><li><xref ref="Chapter_07" text="title"/><mdash/>   an important geometric property of shapes and rigid bodies.</li><li><xref ref="Chapter_08" text="title"/><mdash/>  forces and moments within beams and other rigid bodies.</li><li><xref ref="Chapter_09" text="title"/><mdash/>  equilibrium of bodies subject to friction. </li><li><xref ref="Chapter_10" text="title"/><mdash/>  an important property of geometric shapes used in many applications.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p>Your statics course may not cover all of these topics, or may move through them in a different order.</p>
    <p>Below are two examples of the types of problems you’ll learn to solve in statics. Notice that each can be described with a picture and problem statement, a free-body diagram, and equations of equilibrium.</p>

        <description>A standard unit circle is used to describe the angles of vectors in all problems in this text. "Down" is used to indicate that the force acts towards the ground (toward the gravitational center of the earth, or 270 degrees on the unit circle), and "up" is used to indicate that a force acts at 180 degrees from "down" (90 degrees on a unit circle). Similarly, right indicates that the force acts towards zero degrees on the unit circle, and left indicates that a force acts towards 180 degrees on a unit circle.</description>

        <description>A schematic showing the relationship between subjects take by engineers. Calculus and Physics are the foundation to be able to learn engineering statics. The "Engineering Mechanics Trilogy" is encircled, and the relationships described between the three subjects - statics, dynamics, and solids. Statics is depicted as "no movement". Dynamics is depicted as "Hold on. Everything is moving." Solids is depicted as "it's what inside that counts". After learning statics, you will move to Solids (mechanics of materials) by learning about shear and moment, frames, and virtual work. Also from the fundamentals of statics you will move to Dynamics, where you will learn more about friction and machines. A common thread between all three subjects is includes equilibrium, moment of inertia, and centroids. Additional content that you'll add to your Statics knowledge in Solids includes: stress and strain, material properties, and torsion. Additional content you'll add to your Statics knowledge in Dynamics is the concept that the sum of the forces is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration and that this is NOT equal to zero, as it is in Statics. You will also learn about motion and accelerations.</description>

      <ul>
        <li>What are the two types of motion?</li>
        <li>What three relationships do Newton’s laws of motion define?</li>
        <li>What are physical examples for each of Newton’s three laws of motion?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <introduction>
      <p>The English scientist Sir Issac Newton established the foundation of mechanics in 1687 with his three laws of motion, which describe the relation between forces, objects and motion.   Motion can be separated into two types:
<ul marker=""><li><p><term>Translation</term><mdash/> where a body changes position without changing its orientation in space, and</p></li><li><p><term>Rotation</term><mdash/>  where a body spins about an axis fixed in space, without changing its average position.</p></li></ul>
      </p>
      <p>Some moving bodies are purely translating, others are purely rotating, and many are doing both. Conveniently, we can usually separate translation and rotation and analyze them individually with independent equations.</p>
      <p>Newton's three laws and their implications with respect to translation and rotation are described below.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="newtons-first-law">
      <title>Newton’s 1st Law</title>
      <p>Newton’s first law states that </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force</em>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This law, also sometimes called the <q>law of inertia,</q> tells us that bodies maintain their current velocity unless a net force is applied to change it. In other words, an object at rest it will remain at rest and a moving object will hold its current speed and direction unless an unbalanced force causes a velocity change.  Remember that velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction, so an unbalanced force may cause an object to speed up, slow down, or change direction.</p>

      <p>	Newton’s first law also applies to angular velocities, however instead of force, the relevant quantity which causes an object to rotate is called a <term>torque</term> by physicists, but usually called a <term>moment</term> by engineers.  A moment, as you will learn in <xref ref="Chapter_04"/>, is the rotational tendency of a force. Just as a force will cause a change in linear velocity, a moment will cause a change in angular velocity.  This can be seen in things like tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other objects that spin on an axis when a moment is applied, but eventually stop because of the opposite moment produced by friction.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="newtons-second-law">
      <title>Newton’s 2nd Law</title>
      <p>	Newton’s second law is usually succinctly stated with the familiar equation </p>
      <p>
        <men xml:id="second-law"> \vec{F} = m \vec{a} </men>
      </p>
      <p>where <m>\vec{F}</m> is net force, <m>m</m> is mass, and <m>\vec{a}</m> is acceleration.</p>
      <p>You will notice that the force and the acceleration are in bold face. This means these are vector quantities, having both a magnitude and a direction. Mass on the other hand is a scalar quantity, which has only a magnitude.  This equation indicates that a force will cause an object to accelerate in the direction of the net force, and the magnitude of the acceleration will be proportional to the net force but inversely proportional to the mass of the object.   </p>
      <p>In this course, Statics, we are only concerned with bodies which are <em>not</em> accelerating which simplifies things considerably. When an object is not accelerating <m>a = 0</m>, which implies that it is either at rest or moving with a constant velocity.  With this restriction <xref ref="second-law" text="custom">Newton's Second Law</xref> for translation simplifies to </p>
      <p>
        <men>\sum \vec{F}=0</men>
      </p>
      <p>where <m>\sum \vec{F}</m> is used to indicate the <em>net</em> force acting on the object.</p>
      <p>	Newton’s second law for rotational motions is similar</p>
      <p><men xml:id="second-law-rotation">\vec{M} =I \boldsymbol{\alpha}</men>.</p>
      <p>This equation states that a net moment <m>\vec{M}</m> acting on an object will cause an angular acceleration <m>\boldsymbol{\alpha}</m> proportional to the net moment and inversely proportional to <m>I</m>, a quantity known as the <term>mass moment of inertia.</term> Mass moment of inertia for rotational acceleration is analogous to ordinary mass for linear acceleration.  We will have more to say about the moment of inertia in <xref ref="Chapter_10"/>.	</p>
      <p>Again, we see that the net moment and angular acceleration are vectors, quantities with magnitude and direction. The mass moment of inertia, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity and has only a magnitude. Also, since Statics deals only with objects which are <em>not</em> accelerating  <m>\boldsymbol{\alpha} = 0</m>, they will always be at rest or rotating with constant angular velocity.  With this restriction Newton's second law implies that the net moment on all static objects is zero.</p>
      <p>
        <men>\sum \vec{M}=0</men>
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="newtons-third-law">
      <title>Newton’s 3rd Law</title>
      <p>	Newton’s Third Law states </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The actions and reactions Newton is referring to are <term>forces</term>.  Forces occur whenever one object interacts with another, either directly like a push or pull, or indirectly like magnetic or gravitational attraction.  Any force acting on one body is always paired with another equal-and-opposite force acting on some other body. </p>

        </image>
      </figure>
      <p> These equal-and-opposite pairs can be confusing, particularly when there are multiple interacting bodies.  To clarify, we always begin solving statics problems by drawing a <term>free-body diagram</term>
        <mdash/> a sketch where we isolate a body or system of interest and identify the forces acting <em>on</em> it, while ignoring any forces exerted <em>by</em> it on interacting bodies.</p>
      <p>Consider the situation in figure <xref ref="table_book"/>.  Diagram (a) shows a book resting on a table supported by the floor. The weights of the book and table are placed at their centers of gravity. To solve for the forces on the legs of the table, we use the free-body diagram in (b) which treats the book and the table as a single system and replaces the floor with the forces of the floor <em>on</em> the table. In diagram (c) the book and table are treated as independent objects.  By separating them, the equal-and-opposite interaction forces of the book <em>on</em> the table and the table <em>on</em> the book are exposed.</p>

    <title>Units</title>
    <objectives>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the similarities and differences between the SI and US Customary Unity Systems?</li>
        <li>How do you convert a value into different units?</li>
        <li>When a Statics problem lists the pounds [lb] of a body, is this referring to pounds-force [lbf] or pounds-mass [lbm]?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>Quantities used in engineering usually consist of a numeric value and an associated unit. The value by itself is meaningless. When discussing a quantity you must always include the associated unit, except when the correct unit is <sq>no units.</sq>
    </p>
    <p>In the United States two primary unit systems are commonly in use, the International System of Units and the US Customary System.  Although in statics we will be most concerned with force and length and less so with other units, as an engineer you should be comfortable using any unit in either system.</p>
    <p>The International System of Units, SI, an abbrivation for the French <foreign>Système international (d'unités)</foreign> is the modern form of the metric system and is the most widely used system of measurement worldwide. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units: the second, meter, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, candela.  In statics, the only the first three base units are used.   All other units required are derived from combinations of the base units.  Prefixes to unit names are used to specify the base-10 multiple of the original unit.  </p>
    <p>The United States customary system was developed from the measurement system in use in the British Empire before the US became an independent country. However, the United Kingdom’s system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the Imperial system, changing the definitions of some units. Therefore, while many US units are similar to their Imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems. The base units in the customary system for time, distance, and mass are the second, foot, and slug. </p>
    <p> Force is related to mass and acceleration by Newton’s second law <men>F = ma</men>, so force has the units of mass <m>[m]</m> multiplied by length <m>[L]</m> divided by time <m>[t]</m> squared <me>F= [m L/t^2]</me>.</p>
    <p>In SI system, the unit of force is the newton, abbreviated N, and the unit of mass is the kilogram, abbreviated kg. One newton, is the force which, when applied to a one kilogram mass causes it to accelerate at a rate of <m>\aSI{1}</m>. One newton is equal to <m>\mathrm{1\ kg \cdot m}/\mathrm{s}^2</m>.</p>
    <p>In US Customary units, the unit of force is the pound-force, abreviated  <m>\mathrm{lbf}, </m> or pound for short, and the unit of mass is the slug. In this system, one pound of force will accelerate a mass of one slug at <m>\aUS{1}</m>, so one pound-force  is equal to <m>\mathrm{1\ slug \cdot ft}/\mathrm{s}^2</m>.  On earth, a 1 slug mass weighs <m>\lbf{32.2}</m>. </p>
    <p>You may ocasionally see mass expessed in units of pounds-mass, rather than in slugs.  The advantage of this unit choice is that a <m>\lbm{1}</m> mass weighs <m>\lbf{1}</m> on earth, meaining that <m>g = \aUS{1}</m>.</p>

    <p><xref ref="units_table"/> shows the standard units of weight, mass, length, time, and gravitational acceleration in three unit systems. The gravitational <q>constant</q>
      <m>g</m> varies up to about 0.5% across the earth’s surface due to factors including latitude and elevation, but for the purpose of this course the values in this table are sufficiently accurate.</p>
    <p>It is important to understand that mass and weight are not the same thing. Mass describes how much matter an object contains, while weight is a force and it is the effect of gravity on an object. You find the weight of an object from its mass by applying Newton’s Second Law with the local acceleration of gravity <m>g</m>.

    <p>Awareness of units will help you prevent errors in your engineering calculations. You should always: <ul><li>Pay attention to the units of every quantity in the problem.  Forces should have force units, distances should have distance units, <etc/>
        </li><li>Use the unit system given in the problem statement.</li><li>Avoid unit conversions when possible.  If you must, convert given values to a consistent set of units and stick with them. </li><li>Check your work for unit consistency.  You can only add or subtract quantities which have the same units. When multiplying or dividing quantities with units, multiply or divide the units as well. The units of quantities on both sides of the equals sign must be the same.</li><li>Develop a sense of the magnitudes of the units and consider your answers for reasonableness.  A kilogram is about 2.2 times as massive as a pound-mass and a newton weighs about a quarter pound.</li><li>Be sure to include units with every answer.</li></ul>

      <ul>
        <li>What are some of the fundamental types of forces used in statics? </li>
        <li>Why do we often simplify distributed forces with equivalent forces?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>Statics is a course about forces and we will have a lot to say about them.  At its simplest, a force is a <q>push or pull,</q> but forces come from a variety of sources and occur in many different situations.  As such we need a specialized vocabulary to talk about them. We are also interested in forces that cause rotation, and we have special terms to describe these too.</p>
    <p>As an example of the types of forces you will encounter in statics consider the forces affecting a box on a rough surface being pulled by a cable. The loading on the box can be represented by four different types of force. The cable causes a point force, the normal and friction forces are reaction forces, and the weight is a body force.</p>

        <description>A box is shown with a force pulling it toward the reader. It is on a rough surface. The force pulling the box is a point force (e.g., a cable). There is also a normal reaction of the surface on the bottom surface of the box (F_N is perpindicular to the surface). As the box is pulled towards the reader, a frictional force is developed that is parallel to the surface and opposite the direction of motion. The weight of the box is represented as a force going down. In reality, the weight of the box is distributed across the entire surface of contact, as is the normal force.</description>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>Some of the important terms used describe different types of forces are given below; others will be defined as needed later in the book.</p>
    <p>A <term>point force</term> is a force that acts at a single point.  Examples would be the push you give to open a door, the thrust of a rocket engine, or the pull of the chain suspending a wrecking ball. In reality, point forces are an idealization as all forces are distributed over some amount of area.  Point forces are also called <term>concentrated forces</term>. Point forces are the easiest type to deal with computationally so we will learn some mathematical tools to represent other types as point forces.</p>
    <p><term>Body forces</term> are forces that are distributed throughout a three dimensional body. The most common body force is the weight of an object, but there are other body forces including buoyancy and forces caused by gravitational, electric, and magnetic fields. Weight and buoyancy will be the only body forces we consider in this book. </p>
    <p>In many situations, these forces are small in comparison to the other forces acting on the object, and as such may be neglected.  In practice, the decision to neglect forces must be made on the basis of sound engineering judgment; however, in this course you should consider the weight in your analysis if the problem statement provides enough information to determine it, otherwise you may ignore it. </p>
    <p>In the example above, the point force due to the cable, and the weight of the box are both called <term>loads</term>.  The weight of an object and any forces intentionally applied to it are considered loads, while forces which hold a loaded object in equilibrium or hold parts of an object together are not.</p>
    <p>R<term>eaction forces</term> or simply <term>reactions</term> are the forces and moments which hold or constrain an object or mechanical system in equilibrium.  They are called the reactions because they react when other forces on the system change.  If the load on a system increases, the reaction forces will automatically increase in response to maintain equilibrium. Reaction forces are introduced in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> and reaction moments are introduced in <xref ref="Chapter_05"/>.</p>
    <p>In the example above, the force of the ground on the box is a reaction force, and is distributed over the entire contact surface.  The reaction force can be divided into two parts:  a <term>normal</term> component which acts perpendicular to the surface and supports the box's weight, and a <term>tangential</term> friction component which acts parallel to the ground and resists the pull of the cable.</p>
    <p>The weight, normal component, and frictional component are all examples of <term>distributed forces</term> since they act over a volume or area and not at a single point.  For computational simplicity we usually model distributed forces with equivalent point forces.  This process is discussed in <xref ref="Chapter_07"/>.</p>

    <title>Problem Solving</title>
    <objectives>
      <ul>
        <li>What are some strategies to practice selecting a tool from your problem-solving toolbox?</li>
        <li>What is the basic problem-solving process for equilibrium?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>Statics may be the first course you take where you are required to decide on your own how to approach a problem.  Unlike your previous physics courses, you can't just memorize a formula and plug-and-chug to get an answer; there are often multiple ways to solve a problem, not all of them equally easy, so before you begin you need a plan or strategy.   This seems to cause a lot of students difficulty.</p>
    <p>The ways to think about forces, moments and equilibrium, and the mathematics used to manipulate them are like tools in your toolbox. Solving statics problems requires acquiring, choosing, and using these tools. Some problems can be solved with a single tool, while others require multiple tools. Sometimes one tool is a better choice, sometimes another.  You need familiarity and practice to get skilled using your tools.  As your skills and understanding improve, it gets easier to recognize the most efficient way to get a job done.</p>
    <p>Struggling statics students often say things like:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <q> I don't know where to start the problem.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        <q> It looks so easy when you do it.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>If I only knew which equation to apply, I could solve the problem.</q>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These statements indicate that the students think they know how to use their tools, but are skipping the planning step.  They jump right to writing equations and solving for things without making much progress towards the answer, or they start solving the problem using a reasonable approach but abandon it in mid-stream to try something else.  They get lost, confused and give up. </p>
    <p>Choosing a strategy gets easier with experience. Unfortunately, the way you get that experience is to solve problems.  It seems like a chicken and egg problem and it is, but there are ways around it. Here are some suggestions which will help you become a better problem-solver.<ul><li>Get fluent with the math skills from algebra and trigonometry.</li><li>Do lots of problems, starting with simple ones to build your skills.</li><li>Study worked out solutions, however don't assume that just because you understand how someone else solved a problem that you can do it yourself without help.</li><li>Solve problems using multiple approaches. Confirm that alternate approaches produce the same results, and try to understand why one method was easier than the other.</li><li>	Draw neat, clear, labeled diagrams.</li><li>Familiarize yourself with the application, assumptions, and terminology of the methods covered in class and the textbook.</li><li>When confused, identify what is confusing you and ask questions.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p>The majority of the topics in this book focus on equilibrium.  The remaining topics are either preparing you for solving equilibrium problems or setting you up with skills that you will use in later classes. For equilibrium problems, the problem-solving steps are:
<ol><li>      Read and understand the problem.</li><li>       Identify what you are asked to find and what is given.</li><li>       Stop, think, and decide on an strategy.</li><li>       Draw a free-body diagram and define variables.</li><li>          Apply the strategy to solve for unknowns and check solutions.</li><li><p><ol><li>          Write equations of equilibrium based on the free-body diagram.</li><li>          Check if the number of equations equals the number of unknowns. If it doesn’t, you are missing something. You may need additional free-body diagrams or other relationships.</li><li>          Solve for unknowns.</li></ol></p></li><li>      Conceptually check solutions.</li></ol>
    </p>
    <p>Using these steps does not guarantee that you will get the right solution, but it will help you be critical and conscious of your chosen strategies. This reflection will help you learn more quickly and increase the odds that you choose the right tool for the job. </p>
