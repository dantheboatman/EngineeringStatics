<div class="para">A power screw assembly includes a nut with matching internal threads which fits around the screw. There are two ways that a power screw can operate based on the movement of the screw and nut. In a scissors jack, the operator rotates the threaded rod with a crank fitted to the nut on the right, which is not threaded but acts as a thrust bearing. The nut on the left moves along the stationary screw to raise the load. In the C-clamp, the nut is stationary and the screw translates through as it rotates. In either case, a small moment on the screw can cause enormous forces on the nut, with the added benefit of the force being applied at a precise location as controlled by the screw.</div>
