<div class="para">These results are the change in shear and moment over a segment; to find the actual shear and moment functions <span class="process-math">\(V(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M(x)\)</span> for the entire beam we will need to find initial values for each segment. This is equivalent to using boundary conditions to find the constant of integration when solving a differential equation. The initial values come from either the final value of the previous segment or from point loads or point moments. Because of the requirement for these segment starting values, no segment can be computed in isolation from the other segments. Physically this means that the shear and moment along a beam are not just due to the loading in one segment, but are related to the loading on the rest of the beam as well.</div>
