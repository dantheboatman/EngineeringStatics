<div class="para">An understanding of friction is important factor in the design, functionality and performance of many mechanical systems. In this text we will only consider dry friction out of the many types of friction listed above. So far, we have only looked at situations where friction could be safely ignored; however, there are many cases where the effect of dry friction is significant. These include slipping or tipping, blocks, wedges, screws, belts, bearings, and rotating discs. These are the subject of this chapter.</div>
