<div class="para">If technology isnâ€™t available to you, such as during an exam, you can still use a ruler and protractor to draw the force triangle, but your results will only be as accurate as your diagram. In the best case, using a sharp pencil and carefully measuring lengths and angles, you can only expect about two significant digits of accuracy from a hand-drawn triangle. Nevertheless, even a roughly drawn triangle can give you an idea of the correct answers and be used to check your work after you use another method to solve the problem.</div>
