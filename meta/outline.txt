          "@DB: Need separate sections for 2D and 3D? @acg: this is a topic that I have beocome very passionate about in the past 2 years.  I think we should use the phrases "replace" and "move" very sparingly.  This a very powerful concept and one that should be carefully developed. Young engineers will quickly and unknowingly extend this concept into an incorrect application.  They will literally replace distributed loads with a point load and solve the rest of the problem (say now in mechanics II, beam deflection) with a point load as the loading on the beam.  I like titling this section "Statically Equivalent Loadings"
