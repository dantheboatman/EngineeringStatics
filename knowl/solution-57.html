These constraints are represented by two perpendicular forces and a concentrated moment, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/reactions-from-supports-2d.html" title="Figure 5.2.1">FigureÂ 5.2.1</a>.

The unknowns are the two force components <span class="process-math">\(A_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A_y\)</span> and the scalar moment <span class="process-math">\(M_A\)</span> caused by the fixed connection. If you prefer, you may represent force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\)</span> as a force of unknown magnitude acting at an unknown direction. Whether you represent it as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> components or as a magnitude and direction, there are two unknowns associated with force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{A}\text{.}\)</span>
