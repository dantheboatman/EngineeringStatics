<div class="para">We made a point of saying that equivalent systems of force have the same <span class="process-math">\(external\)</span> effect on the body.  This implies that there may be some other effects which are not the same.  As you will see in <a href="Chapter_08.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 8: Internal Loadings">Chapter 8</a>, we sometimes need to consider  internal forces and moments.  These are the forces inside a body which hold all the parts of the object to each other, otherwise it would break apart and fail.  Although the external effects are the same for all equivalent systems, the internal forces depend on the specifics of how the loads are applied.</div>
