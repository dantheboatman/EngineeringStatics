  <title>Moments and Static Equivalence</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
			When a force acts on a body, it can potentially produce two effects: translation of the body in the direction of the force, and rotation of the body about an axis.
			For a body in equilibrium we say that forces have a <em>tendency</em> to produce translation or rotation since no actual acceleration or motion occurs.
		</p>
    <p>
			The rotational tendency of a force is the subject of this chapter.
			Engineers call this rotational tendency a <term>moment</term>, short for <q>moment of a force.</q> You may remember the using the term <term>torque</term> for the same quantity in physics.
			Physicists use <em>torque</em> specifically for a moment of a force, and <em>moment</em> for the product of <em>any</em> physical quantity with distance.
			To an engineer, a torque means a moment about the long axis of an object that produces twisting and torsional stresses.
		</p>
    <p>
      A wrench provides a familiar example.
			A force <m>\vec{F}</m> applied to the handle of a wrench, as shown in <xref ref="wrench-view-1"/>, creates a moment <m>\vec{M}_A</m> about an axis perpendicular to the page through the center of the nut at <m>A</m>.
			The <m>\vec{M}</m> is bold because moments are vector quantities, and the subscript <m>A</m> indicates the axis or center of rotation.
			The direction of the moment can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on how the force is applied.
			If the nut is frozen, no actual rotation occurs, but the force still produces a tendency to rotate it,
      <ie/>
      a moment.

      <p>
				A moment of force, or torque, is a measure of the tendency of that force to rotate a body about a selected point or axis, called the <term>moment center</term>.
				This tendency increases with the magnitude of the force, and also with the distance between the line-of-action of the force and the moment center.
			</p>
      <p>
				Moments are vector quantities, so they have magnitude and direction and obey all the rules of vector arithmetic, even dot and cross products, described in <xref ref="Chapter_02"/>.
			</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_04-magnitude-of-a-moment">
      <title>Magnitude of a Moment</title>
      <p>
				The magnitude of a moment describes how hard it turns, in the same way that the magnitude of a force describes how hard it pushes or pulls.
				When you turn a door knob, the magnitude of the moment is how hard you twist the knob.
			</p>
      <p>
				The magnitude of a moment is found by multiplying the magnitude of the force by the distance between the line of action of the force and the center of rotation, as illustrated in <xref ref="wrench_view_2"/>.
				This distance called the <term>moment arm</term> or the <term>perpendicular distance</term>, <m>d_{\perp}</m>.
				<men xml:id="moment-definition">M =F d_{\perp}
				</men>.
			</p>
      <p>
				Since the moment is the product of the force's magnitude and the perpendicular distance, the closer the point is to the force's line of action, the smaller the moment.
				If the point lies upon the force's line of action, then the moment arm is zero, making the moment zero as well.
				But notice that a force may be slid along its line-of-action without changing the moment, because neither the magnitude of the force nor the moment arm changes.
				The magnitude of a moment is a positive quantity regardless of whether it produces a clockwise or counter-clockwise tendency.
			</p>
      <p>
				Moments are the product of a force with a distance, so they have units of [force] <m>\times</m> [distance] such as N-m or ft-lb.

							By inspection we see that the tension produces a counterclockwise rotation and the load produces a clockwise rotation.
							Counterclockwise moment <m>M_2</m> is greater than clockwise moment <m>M_1</m> because the boom pendant must also support the weight of the boom, which we have not accounted for.

      <title>Direction of a Moment</title>
      <p>
							In two-dimensional problems, moment vectors are perpendicular to the page and moments simplify to clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation about a <em>point</em>, called the <term>point of interest</term> or <term>moment center</term>.
							The point of interest can be visualized as the point where the axis of rotation pierces the page.
							Since these moment vectors point into the third dimension, they are usually drawn as circular arrows in the plane of the page.
						</p>
      <p>
        Consider the two moments acting on a horizontal surface, shown below.
							To determine the <em>sense</em> of these moments,
        <ie/>
        whether the vectors point up or down, apply the right hand rule.
							Imagine grasping the axis of rotation with your right hand, with your fingers curling in the direction of rotation; your thumb then points in the direction of the moment vector.
							Using this technique, we see that counter-clockwise moments point up, or out of the page, while the clockwise moments point down or into the page.
							In other words, counter-clockwise moment vectors point towards the positive <m>z</m> direction and clockwise moments point in the <m>-z</m> direction.

							As discussed in <xref ref="Chapter_02-direction-of-unit-vectors"/>, there are several alternative methods for applying the right-hand rule, however they all define a direction that is mutually perpendicular to two other vectors.
							To find the direction of a moment, the first of these vectors is a position vector which points <em>from</em> the point of interest <em>to</em> a point on the force's line of action, and is designated <m>\vec{r}</m>.

    <title>Scalar Addition of Moments</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
							Since moments are vectors, they add according to the rules of vector addition.
							In three dimensions this usually involves finding the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> components of two or more moments and adding them to find the components of the resultant moment.
						</p>
      <p>
							A simpler and more interactives approach using scalar components is available for moments in two dimensions.

    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>Scalar Components</title>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="scalar-components"/> we saw that vectors can be expressed as the product of a <term>scalar component</term> and a <term>unit vector</term>.
							For example, a <m>\N{100}</m> force acting in the <m>-\jhat</m> direction,
        <ie/>
        straight down, can be represented by
							<me>
								\vec{F} = F_y\ \jhat = -\N{100}\ \jhat
							</me>,
							where <m>F_y=\N{-100}</m> is the scalar component and <m>\jhat</m> is the unit vector.
							The absolute value of <m>F_y</m> determines the magnitude of the force, and unit vector along with the sign of <m>F_y</m> determines its direction.
							The negative sign here indicates that the direction of <m>\vec{F}</m> is opposite to the direction of <m>\jhat</m>.
						
      
      
      
      
      </p>
      <p>
        We have previously established two sign conventions for scalar components; we now add a third:
        <ul>
          <li>
									For forces acting in the <m>x</m> direction, <em>right is positive</em>, corresponding to the direction of <m>\ihat</m>.
								</li>
          <li>
									For forces acting in the <m>y</m> direction, <em>up is positive</em>, corresponding to the direction of <m>\jhat</m>.
								</li>
          <li>
									For moments acting in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane, <em>counterclockwise moments are positive</em>, corresponding to the direction of <m>\khat</m> according to the right-hand rule.
								</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <title>Addition of Moments</title>
      <p>
							Scalar components are most useful for adding and finding the resultant of several moments.
							When moments are expressed in terms of scalar components, vector addition can reduced to algebraic addition of the scalar components.
						</p>
      <p>
							To add several moment in a plane using scalar components, simply append a positive sign to the magnitude for counter-clockwise moments or a negative sign for clockwise moments to create a scalar component, then add the scalar components normally.
						</p>
      <p>
							The resulting algebraic sum of the scalar components will be either positive, negative, or zero, and this sign indicates the direction of the resultant moment.
							If the result is positive the resultant acts in the direction of the unit vector, and in the opposite direction if it is negative.

    <title>Varignon's Theorem</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
							Varignon's Theorem is a method to calculate moments developed in 1687 by French mathematician Pierre Varignon (1654 <ndash/> 1722).
							It states that
						</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
								The sum of the moments of several concurrent forces about a point is equal to the moment of the resultant of those forces, or alternately, the moment of a force about a point equals the sum of the moments of its components.
							</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
							This means you can find the moment of a force by first breaking it into components, evaluating the moments of the individual components, and finally summing them to find the net moment about the point.
						</p>
      <p>
							This may sound like more work than just finding the moment of the original force, but in practice, it is often easier.
						</p>
      <p>
							When applying Varignon's Theorem, you are free to select components in any direction, but the two most convenient choices are discussed below.
						</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="perpendicular-component">
      <title>Parallel and Perpendicular Components</title>
      <p>
							The first common way to apply Verignon's Theorem is to break the force creating the moment into two components, one parallel with the line segment connecting the moment center with the point of application of the force, and the other perpendicular to it.
						</p>
      <p>
        Consider the wrench in the interactive diagram below.
							Assume that the length of the handle is <m>d</m>, the magnitude of the force is <m>F</m> and the angle between the force and the handle is <m>\theta</m>.
							The components parallel to the wrench handle and perpendicular to it are
        <md>
          <mrow>
            F_\| \amp= F \cos \theta \amp F_\perp \amp= F \sin \theta
          </mrow>
        </md>
        .
							By Verignon's theorem and the definition of the moment, <xref ref="moment-definition"/>, the sum of the moments of the components simplifies to:
							<men xml:id="moment-fperp"> M = F_\perp d
							</men>,
							because the contribution of the parallel component is zero since its line of action passes through the moment center <m>A</m>.
						
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="wrench_view_3">
        <caption>Varignon's Theorem: Perpendicular Component </caption>
        <xi:include href="interactives.ptx" xpointer="wrench-3_interactive"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
							This result agrees with our intuitive understanding of how a wrench works; the greatest torque is developed when the force is applied at a right angle to the handle.
						</p>
      <p>
							Equations <xref ref="moment-definition"/> and <xref ref="moment-fperp"/> not only produce the same result, but they are also completely identical.
							If the length of the handle is <m>d</m> and the angle between the force <m>\vec{F}</m> and the handle is <m>\theta</m>, then <m>d_\perp = d \sin \theta</m>, and <m>F_\perp = F \sin \theta</m>.
							Using either equation to calculate the moment gives
							<men xml:id="moment-general">M = F\ d_\perp = F_\|\ d = F\ d\ \sin \theta
							</men>.

															Determinants are a robust way to compute two-dimensional cross products but take a bit more effort than Varignon's Theorem.
															The math is <em>exactly the same</em> either way, which means that Varignon's Theorem is just a shortcut to working through a two-dimensional vector determinant.

															The signs on the cross-product terms <m>\vec{r}_x \times \vec{F}_y</m> and <m>\vec{r}_y \times \vec{F}_x</m> still come from the right-hand rule, and conveniently the process of multiplying diagonals in the determinant takes care of the signs.

									We have discussed several different approaches for finding the moment of a force about a point in the preceding sections.
									While all of these methods produce the same result, frequently you will find that one method is computationally simpler to apply than another.
									The simplest method generally depends on what is know and unknown in a given situation, so we recommend that you become familiar with all these methods.

									In three dimensions, it is usually not convenient to use geometry to find the moment arm for equation <xref ref="moment-definition"/>, so instead we will use the vector cross product method, which is easier to apply but less intuitive.

									Here, <m>\theta</m> is the angle between the two vectors as shown in <xref ref="wrench_view_4"/> above, and <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> is the unit vector perpendicular to both <m>\vec{r}</m> and <m>\vec{F}</m> with the direction coming from the right-hand rule.

        <ul>
          <li>
											The order must always be <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m>, never <m>\vec{F}\times\vec{r}</m>.
											The moment arm <m>\vec{r}</m> appears in the middle line of the determinant and the force <m>\vec{F}</m> on the bottom line.
										</li>
          <li>
											The moment arm <m>\vec{r}</m> must always be measured from the moment center to the line of action of the force.
											Never from the force to the point.
										</li>
          <li>
											The signs of the components of <m>\vec{r}\text{ and }\vec{F}</m> must follow those of a right-hand coordinate system.

      </p>

									The first shows the force vector, position vector and the resulting moment all placed at the origin for simplicity.
									The moment is perpendicular to the plane containing <m>\vec{F}</m> and <m>\vec{r}</m> and has a magnitude equal to the <sq>area</sq> of the parallelogram with <m>\vec{F}</m> and <m>\vec{r}</m> for sides.

									In three dimensions, the moment of a force about a point can be resolved into components about the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axes.
									The moment produces a rotational tendency about all three axes simultaneously, but only a portion of the total moment acts about any particular axis.
								</p>
      <p>
									We are often interested in finding the effect of a moment about a specific line or axis.
									For example, consider the moment created by a push on a door handle.
									Unless you push with a force exactly perpendicular to the hinge, only a portion of the total moment you produce will act around the hinge axis and be effective to open the door.
									The moment we are looking for is the vector projection of the moment onto the axis of interest.
									Vector projections were first discussed in <xref ref="vector-projections"/>.

        To find the moment of a force about a line, three vectors are required:
        <ul>
          <li><m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m>, a unit vector pointing in the direction of the line or axis of interest.
										</li>
          <li><m>\vec{r}</m>, a position vector from any point on the line of interest to any point on the line of action of the force.
										</li>
          <li><m>\vec{F}</m>, the force vector.
											If you have multiple concurrent forces, you can treat them individually or add them together first and find the moment of the resultant.
										</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
									Using these three vectors, we can compute the magnitude of the moment about a line in two related, but unique ways.

      <p>
        <term>Two-Step Method</term>: Separates the cross and dot products into two distinct steps.
        <ul>
          <li>
											First, compute the moment of a the force about any point on the line of interest using the cross product, <xref ref="rxf"/>.
											<me>
												\vec{M} = (\vec{r} \times \vec{F})
											</me></li>
          <li>
											Next, find the scalar projection of the moment onto the line of interest using a dot product, <xref ref="projection2"/>.
											<me>
												M_{line}=\|\proj_{\vec{u}} \vec{M}\| = \vec{M} \cdot \hat{\vec{u}}

      <p>
        <term>Scalar Triple Product</term>: Combines the cross and dot product into the determinant of a  3 <m>\times</m> 3 matrix formed from the three vectors above.
        <ul>
          <li>
											The scalar triple product consists of taking the determinant of a matrix consisting of the components of the line's unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> in the top row, the components of a position vector <m>\vec{r}</m> in the middle row, and the components of the <m>\vec{F}</m> in the bottom row.
											The determiant can be computed in multiple ways, but we suggest using the augmented determinant method <xref ref="augmented-determinant"/> or computing it directly in a calculator which allows 3 <m>\times</m> 3 matrix computations.

          <li>
											Note that the above determinant does <em>not</em> contain any unit vectors, like the <m>\ihat,\ \jhat</m>, and <m>\khat</m> vectors that show up in the top of cross-product determinants.
											Therefore, you are just multiplying the <em>numbers</em> in the diagonals and adding them up to a scalar value.
										</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
									A positive value indicates that the moment vector points in the <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> direction, while a negative value indicate the moment points in the opposite direction.
								</p>
      <p>
									Finally if you need to find the vector components of this moment about a line, multiplying the scalar projection by the line's unit vector will add direction to your scalar moment value, <xref ref="projection3"/><men xml:id="moment-projection">\vec{M_{line}}=\vec{M}_{\hat{\vec{u}}} = \|\proj_{\vec{u}} \vec{M}\|\ \hat{\vec{u}}

            <p>
												Keep in mind that to compute the magnitude of a moment about a line, we need to compute a vector moment about a point on the line and then dot this vector moment onto the line's unit vector.
												There are two options for this computatons:
											</p>
            <p>
              Option 1: The Two-Step Method separates the cross and dot products into two distinct steps.
              <ul>
                <li>
														Compute the vector moment of <m>\vec{P_1}</m> about any point on line <m>\vec{BG}</m>, including <m>\vec{M_G}</m> or <m>\vec{M_B}</m>, then
													</li>
                <li>
														Dot <m>\vec{M}</m> onto the unit vector <m>\widehat{BG}</m></li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              Option 2: The Scalar Triple Product combines the cross and dot product into a single matrix determinant including the following vectors:
              <ul>
                <li>
														Top row: Unit vector for the line of interest <m>\widehat{BG}</m></li>
                <li>
														Middle row: Moment arm from line of interest to force vector.
														We'll use <m>\vec{r}_{HG}</m> as it has the most zeros, which will simplify the algebra when computing the determinant.
													</li>
                <li>
														Bottom row: Components of force vector <m>\vec{P_2}.</m></li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
												Let's set up the vectors for the scalar triple product starting with the unit vector <m>\widehat{BG}</m>.
											</p>
            <p>
              The unit vector <m>\widehat{BG}</m> is found by dividing the positon vector <m>\vec{BG}</m> by its own magnitude.
              <md>
                <mrow>
                  \widehat{BG} = \frac{\vec{BG}}{BG}=\frac{\ft{\langle -2.0, 0.0, 2.0 \rangle}}{\ft{\sqrt{(-2)^2+0^2+2^2}}} = {\langle -0.707, 0.0, 0.707 \rangle}

              <p>
                Next, the middle row of the scalar triple product is one of the moment arms from <m>\vec{BG}</m> to the force <m>\vec{P_2}</m>.
													There are four options which will all result in the same answer after you compute the scalar triple product.
                <md>

                  </mrow>
                </md>
                We'll use <m>\vec{r}_{GH}</m> going forward as it is a one-dimensional vector and the zeros will simplify the determinant.

            <p>
              Finally, the bottom row of the scalar triple product are the force vector components.
              <md>

              </md>
            </p>
            <p>
												Now, combining the three vectors, here is the triple scalar product matrix:
											</p>
            <p>
              <md>
                <mrow>
                  M_{P_2} \text{ about } BG = \begin{vmatrix}

													\ft{0.0} \amp \ft{-2.0} \amp \ft{0.0} \\
													\lbf{25} \amp \lbf{0} \amp \lbf{0}

                </mrow>
              </md>
            </p>
            <sidebyside margins="0%" valign="middle" widths="55%  40%">
              <p>
													Hence, the magnitude of the moment caused by force <m>\vec{P_2}</m> about line <m>\vec{BG}</m> is <m>\ftlbf{35.355}</m>.
													As we found a positive answer, this confirms that the rotation caused by <m>\vec{P_2}</m> is in the same direction as the vector <m>\vec{BG}</m>, this is reinforced by the right-hand rule thumb direction in the diagram.

    <p>
								The moments we have considered so far were all caused by single forces producing rotation about a moment center.
								In this section, we will consider another type of moment, called a <term>couple</term>.
							</p>
    <p>
								A couple consists of two parallel forces, equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and non-coincident.
								Couples are special because the pair of forces always cancel each other, which means that a couple produces a rotational effect but never translation.
								For this reason, couples are sometimes referred to as <q>pure moments.</q> The strength of the rotational effect is called the <term>moment of the couple</term> or the <term>couple-moment</term>.
							</p>
    <p>
								When a single force causes a moment about a point, the magnitude depends on the magnitude of the force and the location of the point.
								In contrast, the moment of a couple is the same at every point and only depends on the magnitude of the opposite forces and the distance between them.
							</p>
    <p>
      For example, consider the interactive where two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action form a couple.
								The moment of this couple is found by summing the moments of the two forces about arbitrary moment center <m>A,</m> applying positive or negative signs for each term according to the right-hand rule.
								The moment of the couple is always
      <mdn>
        <mrow number="yes">
          M \amp= Fd_\perp 
        </mrow>
      </mdn>
      where <m>d_\perp</m> is the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces.

    </figure>
    <p>
								In two dimensions, couples are represented by a curved arrow indicating the direction of the rotational effect.
								Following the right-hand rule, the value will be positive if the moment is counter-clockwise and negative if it is clockwise.
								In three dimensions, a couple is represented by a normal vector arrow.
							</p>
    <p>
								When adding moments to find the total or resultant moment, you must include couple-moments as well the <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments.
								In equation form, we could express this as:
								<me>
									\Sigma M_P = \Sigma (\vec{r}\times\vec{F} ) + \Sigma (\vec{M}_\text{couple})
								</me></p>
    <insight>
      <title>Location Independence</title>
      <p>
									In this section we have shown that couples produce the same moment at every point on the body.
									This means that the external effect of couples is <em>location independent</em>.
									Because the moment of a couple is location independent, the moment vector is not bound to any particular point and for this reason is a <em>free vector</em>.
								</p>
      <p>
									We will learn in <xref ref="Chapter_08"/> that moving a couple around on a rigid body does affect the <em>internal</em> loads or stresses inside a body, but changing the location of a couple does not change the <em>external</em> loading or reactions.

    <p>
								An <em>equivalent transformation</em> occurs when a loading on an object is replaced with another loading that has the same <em>external</em> effect on the object.
								By external effect, we mean the response of the body that we can see from the outside, with no consideration of what happens to it internally.
								If the object is a free body, the external effect would be translation and rotation.
								In statics, since objects are not accelerating, the external effect really means the reactions at the supports required to maintain equilibrium.
								The external effects will be exactly the same before and after an equivalent transformation.
							</p>
    <p>
								Equivalent transformation permits us to swap out one set of forces with another one without changing the fundamental physics of the situation.
								This is usually done to simplify or clarify the situation, or to give you an alternate way to think about, understand, and solve a mechanics problem.
							</p>
    <p>
								You already know several equivalent transformations although we have not used this terminology before.
								Here are some transformations you have applied previously.
							</p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Vector Addition</title>
      <p>
									When you add forces together using the rules of vector addition, you are performing an equivalent transformation.
									You can swap out two or more components and replace them with a single equivalent resultant force.
								</p>
      <p>
									Any number of <em>concurrent</em> forces can be added together to produce a single resultant force.
									By definition, the lines of action of concurrent forces all intersect at a common point.
									The resultant must be placed at this intersection point in order for this replacement to be equivalent.
									This is because before and after the replacement, the moment about the intersection point is zero.
									If the resultant was placed somewhere else, that would not be true.

									Resolving forces into components is also an equivalent transformation, as it is the inverse operation of vector addition.
									The components are usually orthogonal and in the coordinate directions, or in a given plane and perpendicular to it, but any combination of force components that add to the original force is equivalent.

									The effects of the force in the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and (in three dimensions the <m>z</m>) directions remain the same, and by Varignon's theorem, we know that the moment these forces make about any point will also be the same.

      <p>
									An interesting special case occurs when two forces are equal and opposite and have the same line of action.
									When these are added together, they cancel out, so replacing these two forces with nothing is an equivalent transformation.
									The opposite is true as well, so you can make two equal and opposite forces spontaneously appear at a point if you wish.

      <title>Internal Effects</title>
      <p>
									We made a point of saying that equivalent systems of force have the same <m>external</m> effect on the body.
									This implies that there may be some other effects that are not the same.
									As you will see in <xref ref="Chapter_08"/>, we sometimes need to consider internal forces and moments.
									These are the forces inside a body that hold all the parts of the object to each other, otherwise, it would break apart and fail.
									Although the external effects are the same for all equivalent systems, the internal forces depend on the specifics of how the loads are applied.

      <title>Sliding a force along its line of action</title>
      <p>
									Sliding a force along its line of action is an equivalent transformation because sliding a force does not change its magnitude, direction or the perpendicular distance from the line of action to any point, so the moments it creates do not change either.
									This transformation is called the <q>Principle of Transmissibility</q>.

      <title>Replacing a couple with couple-moment or vice-versa</title>
      <p>
									A <em>couple</em>, defined as <q>two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action,</q> produces a pure turning action that is equivalent to a concentrated moment, called the <em>couple-moment</em>.
									Couples and couple-moments have no translational effect.
									Couple-moments are free vectors, which means that they are not bound to any point.
									Their external effect is on the entire body and is the same regardless of where it is applied.
								</p>
      <p>
									This means that you are free to swap out a couple for its couple-moment, or swap a couple-moment for a couple that has the same moment, and you may put the replacement anywhere on you please and it will still be equivalent.
								</p>
      <p>
									The diagram shows a series of equivalent transformations of a couple.

									Concentrated moments are <em>free vectors</em>, which you may draw the circular arrow anywhere you like on the body.
									In other words, moving a concentrated moment from one point to another is an equivalent transformation.
									Remember though, this equivalence only applies to the external effects.
									What happens inside the body definitely does depend on the specific point where the moment is applied.

      <title>Adding moments to produce a resultant moment</title>
      <p>
									If more than one couple-moment or concentrated moment acts on an object the situation may be simplified by adding them together to produce one <em>resultant moment</em>,<em/><m>\vec{M}_R</m>.
									The standard rules of vector addition apply.
								</p>
      <p>
									In two-dimensional problems moments are either clockwise or counter-clockwise, so they may be considered scalar values and added algebraically.
									Give counter-clockwise moments a positive sign and clockwise moments a negative sign according to the right-hand rule sign convention.
									If this is done, the sign of the resultant moment will indicate the direction of the net moment.
									You can use the right-hand rule to establish the direction of the moment vector, which will point into or out of the page.

								A loading system is a combination of load forces and moments that act on an object.
								It can be as simple as a single force, or as complex as a three-dimensional combination of many force and moment vectors.
							</p>
    <p>
								You will see that any loading systems may be replaced with a simpler <em>statically equivalent system</em> consisting of one <em>resultant force</em> at a specific point and one <em>resultant moment</em> by performing a series of equivalent transformations.
								Force system resultants provide a convenient representation for complex force interactions at engineering connections that we will rely on later in a variety of contexts.
								For now, we will focus on the details of reducing a system to a single force and couple.
							</p>
    <p>
								Depending on the original loading system, the resultant force, the resultant moment, or both may be zero.
								If they are both zero, it indicates that the object is in equilibrium under this load condition.
								If they are non-zero, the supports will need to provide an equal and opposite reaction to put the object into equilibrium.
							</p>
    <p>
								The resultant force acting on a system, <m>\vec{R}</m>, can be found from adding the individual forces, <m>\vec{F}_i</m>, such that
								<me>
									\vec{R}=\sum \vec{F} = \vec{F_1}+\vec{F_2}+\vec{F_3}+...
								</me>.
							</p>
    <p/>
    <p>
								The resultant moment, <m>\vec{M}_O</m>, about a point <m>O</m>, can be found from adding all of the moments <m>\vec{M}</m>, about that point, including both <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments and concentrated moments.
							</p>
    <p><me>
									\vec{M_{O}}=\sum \vec{M}_i =\vec{M_1}+\vec{M_2}+\vec{M_3}+...
								</me></p>
    <p/>
    <p>
								It is often more convenient to work with the scalar components of the resultant vectors since they separate the effects in the three coordinate directions.

									One transformation you might want to make is to move a force to another location.
									While <em>sliding</em> a force along its line of action is fine, <em>moving</em> a force to another point changes its line of action and thus its rotational effect on the object, so moving a force to a new line of action is <em>not</em> an equivalent transformation.
								</p>

									Consider the cantilever beam below.
									In diagram (a), the load <m>P</m> is at the end of the beam, and in (b) it has been moved to the center.
									The external effects are shown in (c) and (d).
									Although the vertical reaction force is the <m>P</m> in both cases, the reaction moment at point <m>O</m> is <m>2P\ell</m> in the first case and <m>P\ell</m> in the second.

									Evaluating the moment at point <m>O</m> was an arbitrary choice.
									Any other point would give the same result.
									For example, in the original situation (a) force <m>P</m> makes a clockwise moment <m>M=P\ell</m> about the midpoint.
									When the force is moved to the center <m>P</m> creates no moment there, so a clockwise compensatory couple with a magnitude of <m>P\ell</m> must be added to maintain equivalence.
									This is the same result as we found previously (d).
									The compensatory couple has been drawn centered around the midpoint, but this too is arbitrary because concentrated moments are free vectors and can be placed at any location.

        <p>
										The original system is shown in (a).
									</p>
        <p>
										Since the <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m> are parallel, the magnitude of the resultant force is just the sum of the two magnitudes and it points down.
										<me>
											R = F_1 + F_2

										The resultant moment about point <m>A</m> is
										<me>
											M_A = F_1 d_1 + F_2 (d_1 + d_2)
										</me>.

        <p>
										To create the equivalent system (b), the resultant force and resultant moment are placed at point <m>A</m>.
									</p>
        <p>
										The system in (b) can be further simplified to eliminate the moment at <m>M_A</m>, by performing the process in reverse.

        <p>
										In (c) we place the resultant force <m>R</m> a distance <m>d</m> away from point <m>A</m> such that the resultant moment around point <m>A</m> remains the same.
										This distance can be found using <m>M = Fd</m>.
										<me>
											d = M_A/R
										</me></p>
        <p>
										The systems in (a), (b), and (c) are all statically equivalent
									</p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
								In this example, we started with two forces.
								We have found two different statically equivalent systems; one with a force and a couple, the other with a single force.
								This latter system is simpler than the original system.
							</p>
    <p>
								It is important to note that static equivalence applies to external effects only.
								When determining internal forces, such as the shear and bending moment discussed in <xref ref="VM_diagrams"/> or when considering non-rigid bodies, the original loading system must be used.

      <title>Determining Equivalence</title>

									Two complex loading systems are equivalent if they reduce to the same resultant force and the same resultant moment about any arbitrary point.

								Any load system can be simplified to its resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m>, and resultant couple <m>\vec{M}</m>, acting at any arbitrary point <m>O</m>.
								There are four common special cases, which are worth highlighting individually.
							</p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Concurrent forces</title>
      <p>
									When all forces in a system are concurrent, the resultant moment about their common intersection point will always be zero.
									We then need only find the resultant force and place it at the point of intersection.
									The resultant moment about any other point is the moment of the resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m> about that point.
								</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Parallel forces</title>
      <p>
									When all forces in a system are parallel, the resultant force will act in this direction with a magnitude equal to the sum of the individual magnitudes.
									There will be no moment created about this axis, but we need to find the resultant moment about the other two rectangular axes.
									That is, if all forces act in the <m>x</m> direction, we need only find the resultant force in the <m>x</m> direction and the resultant moment about the <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axes.
								</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Coplanar forces</title>
      <p>
									When all forces in a system are coplanar we need only find the resultant force in this plane and the resultant moment about the axis perpendicular to this plane.
									That is, if all forces exist in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane, we need only to sum components in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions to find resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m>, and use these to determine the resultant moment about the <m>z</m> axis.
									All two-dimensional problems fall into this category.

      <title>Wrench resultant</title>
      <p>
									A wrench resultant is a special case where the resultant moment acts around the axis of the resultant force.
									The directions of the resultant force vector and the resultant moment vector are the same.

        <p>
										For example, if the resultant force is only in the <m>x</m> direction and the resultant moment acts only around the <m>x</m> axis, this is an example of a wrench resultant.
										An everyday example is a screwdriver, where both the resultant force and axis of rotation are in-line with the screwdriver.
										A wrench resultant is considered positive if the couple vector and force vector point in the same direction, and negative if they point in opposite directions.
									</p>
      </sidebyside>
      <p>
									Any three-dimensional force-couple system may be reduced to an equivalent wrench resultant even if the resultant force and resultant moment do not initially form a wrench resultant.
								</p>
      <p>
        To find the equivalent wrench resultant:
        <ol>
          <li>
											First, find the resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m> and resultant moment <m>\vec{M}</m> at an arbitrary at arbitrary point, <m>O</m>.
											These need not act along the same axis.
										</li>
          <li>
											Resolve the resultant moment into scalar components <m>M_\parallel</m> and <m>M_\perp</m>, parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the resultant force.
										</li>
          <li>
											Eliminate <m>M_\perp</m> by moving the resultant force away from point <m>O</m> by distance <m>d = M_\perp/R</m></li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
									The simplified system consists of moment <m>\vec{M}_\parallel</m> and force <m>\vec{R}</m> and acting distance <m>d</m> away from point <m>O</m>.
									Since <m>\vec{R}</m> and <m>\vec{M}_\parallel</m> act along the same axis, the system has been reduced to a wrench resultant.
									Wrench resultants are the most general way to represent a complex force-couple system, but their utility is limited.
