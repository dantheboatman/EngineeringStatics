    <title>About this Book</title>
    <p><pubtitle>Engineering Statics: Open and Interactive </pubtitle> is a free, open-source textbook for anyone who wishes to learn more about vectors, forces, moments, static equilibrium, and the properties of shapes.
			Specifically, it is appropriate as a textbook for Engineering Mechanics: Statics, the first course in the Engineering Mechanics series offered in most university-level engineering programs.
		</p>
    <p>
			This book's content should prepare you for subsequent classes covering Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics and Mechanics of Materials.
			At its core, <pubtitle>Engineering Statics</pubtitle> provides the tools to solve static equilibrium problems for rigid bodies.
			The additional topics of resolving internal loads in rigid bodies and computing area moments of inertia are also included as stepping stones for later courses.
			We have endeavored to write in an approachable style and provide many questions, examples, and interactives for you to engage with and learn from.

      <title>Access</title>
      <p>
				The entire book is available for free as an interactive online ebook at <url href="https://engineeringstatics.org"/>.
				While the interactive version works best on larger screens, it will also work smartphones but with some limitations due to limited screen width.
				A non-interactive PDF version, suitable for printing or offline reading on a tablet or computer, is available at <url href="https://engineeringstatics.org/pdf/statics.pdf"/>.
				The PDF is searchable and easy to navigate using embedded links.

      <title>End of Chapter exercises</title>
      <p>
				The randomized end-of-chapter exercises were made using the <url href="https://www.numbas.org.uk" visual="Numbas"/> open-source assessment system and <url href="https://geogebra.org" visual="Geogebra"/> for the dynamic diagrams.
				Exercises in the <url href="https://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk/project/3501/" visual="Engineering Statics Repository"/> can be freely remixed into your own homework sets or online exams using the <url href="https://numbas.mathcentre.ac.uk" visual="Numbas Editor"/>.
				You can also use the editor to write new questions or modify existing ones.
			</p>
      <p>
				The exercises can be integrated into your institution's Virtual Learning Environment to set deadlines and automatically record grades.
				See the <url href="https://docs.numbas.org.uk/en/latest/tutorials/deliver-to-students.html" visual="Numbas Documentation"/> for more information.
				To fully take advantage of all the features, you may need the support of your institution's IT department to install the <url href=" https://docs.numbas.org.uk/lti/en/latest/" visual="Numbas LTI provider"/>.

      <p>
				Please ask questions about Numbas integration and share any good problems you write with the Engineering Statics Group.

    <title>Acknowledgements</title>
    <p>
			This book is the vision of a handful of instructors who wanted to create a free and open Engineering Statics textbook filled with dynamic, interactive diagrams to encourage visualization and engineering intuition.
		</p>
    <p>
			Dr.
			Baker brought together a team of volunteers from large public universities, small private colleges, and community colleges across the United States to write the text and create the interactive elements.
			Some content was adapted with permission from Jacob Moore's <pubtitle>Mechanics Map - Open Textbook Project</pubtitle>.
			<url href="http://mechanicsmap.psu.edu/"/>.
			After two years of development the book was released to the public in 2020.
		</p>
    <p>
			The book continues to evolve thanks to the contributions, suggestions, and corrections made by users of the text, both professors and students.
			The original authors are listed below, and others who have contributed are acknowledged in the source code on GitHub.
