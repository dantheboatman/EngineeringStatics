<div class="para">So for example, <span class="process-math">\(F_x = \N{10}\)</span> is a scalar component. We can tell it’s not a vector because it <span class="process-math">\(F_x\)</span> is not bold. <span class="process-math">\(\N{10}\)</span> is the magnitude of the associated vector; the subscript <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> indicates that the force acts "in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> direction," in other words it acts on a line of action which is parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis; and the (implied) positive sign means that the vector points towards the positive end of the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis — towards positive infinity. So a scalar component, while not a vector, contains all the information necessary to completely describe and draw the corresponding vector. Be careful not to confuse scalar components with vector magnitudes. A force with a magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(\N{10}\)</span> can point in any direction, but can never have a negative magnitude.</div>
