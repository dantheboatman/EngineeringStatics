<div class="para">There are several ways to think about this equation. Reading it from left to right it says that <em class="emphasis">if all the forces acting on a body sum to zero, then the body will be in equilibrium</em>. If you read it from right to left it says that <em class="emphasis">if a body is in equilibrium, then all the forces acting on the body must sum to zero</em>. Both interpretations are equally valid but we will be using the second one more often. In a typical problem equilibrium of a body implies that the forces sum to zero, and we use that fact to find the unknown forces which make it so. Remember that we are talking about vector addition here, so the sums of the forces must be calculated using the rules of vector addition; you won’t get correct answers if you can’t add vectors!</div>
