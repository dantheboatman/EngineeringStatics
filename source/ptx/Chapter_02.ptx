  <title>Forces and Other Vectors</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
			Before you can solve statics problems, you will need to understand the basic physical quantities used in Statics: scalars and vectors.
		</p>
    <p><term>Scalars</term> are physical quantities that have no associated direction and can be described by a positive or negative number, or even zero.
			Scalar quantities follow the usual laws of algebra, and most scalar quantities have units.
			Mass, time, temperature, and length are all scalars.
		</p>
    <p><term>Vectors</term> represent physical quantities that have magnitude and direction.
			Vectors are identified by a symbolic name which will be typeset in bold like <m>\vec{r}</m> or <m>\vec{F}</m> to indicate its vector nature.
			The primary vector quantity you will encounter in statics will be <term>force</term>, but <term>moment</term> and <term>position</term> are also important vectors.
			Computations involving vectors must always consider the directionality of each term and follow the rules of vector algebra as described in this chapter.

				You can visualize a vector as an <term>arrow</term> pointing in a particular direction.
				The <term>tip</term> is the pointed end and the <term>tail</term> the trailing end.
				The tip and tail of a vector define a <term>line of action</term>.
				A line of action can be thought of as an invisible string along which a vector can slide.
				Sliding a vector along its line of action does not change its magnitude or its direction.
				Sliding a vector can be a handy way to simplify vector problems.

    <p>
			The standard notation for a vector uses the vector's name in bold font, or an arrow or bar above the vector's name.
			All three of these notations mean the same thing.
			<me>
				\vec{F} = \vecarrow{F} = \bar{F} = \textrm{ a vector named } F
			</me>
			Most printed works including this book will use the bold symbol to indicate vectors, but for handwritten work, you and your instructor will use the bar or arrow notation.
		</p>
    <p>
			Force vectors acting on physical objects have a <term>point of application</term>, which is the point where the force is applied.
			Other vectors, such as moment vectors, are <term>free vectors</term>, which means that the point of application is not significant.
			Free vectors can be moved freely to any location as long as the magnitude and direction are maintained.
		</p>
    <p>
			The vector's <term>magnitude</term> is a <em>positive real number</em> including units which describes the <sq>strength</sq> or <sq>intensity</sq> of the vector.
			Graphically a vector's magnitude is represented by the length of its vector arrow, and symbolically by enclosing the vector's symbol with vertical bars.
			This is the same notation as for the absolute value of a number.
			The absolute value of a number and the magnitude of a vector can both be thought of as a distance from the origin, so the notation is appropriate.
			By convention the magnitude of a vector is also indicated by the same letter as the vector, but in non-bold font.
			<me>
				F = |\vec{F}| = \textrm{ the magnitude of vector }\vec{F}
			</me></p>
    <p>
			By itself, a vector's magnitude is a scalar quantity, but it makes no sense to speak of a vector with a negative magnitude so vector magnitudes are always positive or zero.
			Multiplying a vector by -1 produces a vector with the same magnitude but pointing in the opposite direction.
		</p>
    <p>
			Vector directions are described with respect to a <term>coordinate system</term>.
			A coordinate system is an arbitrary reference system used to establish the <term>origin</term> and the primary directions.
			Distances are usually measured from the origin, and directions from a primary or <term>reference direction</term>.
			You are probably familiar with the Cartesian coordinate system with mutually perpendicular <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axes and the origin at their intersection point.
		</p>
    <p>
			Another way of describing a vector's direction is to specify its <term>orientation</term> and <term>sense</term>.
			Orientation is the angle the vector's line of action makes with a specified reference direction, and sense defines the direction the vector points along its line of action.
			A vector with a positive sense points towards the positive end of the reference axis and vice-versa.
			A vector representing an object's weight has a vertical reference direction and a downward sense or negative sense, for example.
		</p>
    <p>
			A third way to represent a vector is with a <term>unit vector</term> multiplied by a <term>scalar component</term>.
			Unit vectors are vectors with a magnitude of one (unitless), and scalar components are signed values with units.
			Together, they fully define a vector quantity; the unit vector specifies the direction of its line of action, and the scalar component specifies its magnitude and sense.
			The scalar component <q>scales</q> the unit vector.
		</p>
    <p>
			Be careful not to confuse scalar components, which can be positive or negative, with vector magnitudes, which are always positive.
		</p>
    <p>
			Vectors are either constant or vary as a function of time, position, or something else.
			For example, if a force varies with time according to the function <m>F(t) = (10\ \textrm{N/s}) t</m>, where <m>t</m> is the time in seconds, then the force will be <m>\N{0}</m> at <m>t=\second{0}</m> and increase by <m>\N{10}</m> each second thereafter.

				The simplest vector calculations involve one-dimensional vectors.
				You can learn some important terminology here without much mathematical difficulty.

				Adding multiple vectors together finds the <term>resultant</term> vector.
				Resultant vectors can be thought of as the <em>sum</em> of or <em>combination</em> of two or more vectors.
			</p>
      <p>
				To find the resultant vector <m>\vec{R}</m> of two one-dimensional vectors <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m> \vec{B}</m> you can use the tip-to-tail technique in <xref ref="fig-ggb-1d-definitions"/> below.
				In the tip-to-tail technique, you slide vector <m>\vec{B}</m> until its tail is at the tip of <m>\vec{A}</m>, and the vector from the tail of <m>\vec{A}</m> to the tip of <m>\vec{B}</m> is the resultant <m>\vec{R}</m>.
				Note that vector addition is commutative: the resultant <m>\vec{R}</m> is the same whether you add <m>\vec{A}</m> to <m>\vec{B}</m> or <m>B</m> to <m>A</m>.

    </objectives>
    <introduction>
      <p>
				A coordinate system gives us a frame of reference to describe a system that we would like to analyze.
				In statics we normally use <term>orthogonal</term> coordinate systems, where orthogonal means <q>perpendicular.</q> In an orthogonal coordinate system the coordinate direction are perpendicular to each other and thereby independent.
				The intersection of the coordinate axes is called the <term>origin</term>, and measurements are made from there.
				Both points and vectors are described with a set of numbers called the <term>coordinates</term>.
				For points in space, the coordinates specify the distance you must travel in each of the coordinate directions to get from the origin to the point in question.
				Together, the coordinates can be thought of as specifying a <term>position vector</term>, a vector from the origin directly to the point.
				The position vector gives the magnitude and direction needed to travel directly from the origin to the point.
			</p>
      <p>
				In the case of force vectors, the coordinates are the <term>scalar components</term> of the force in each of the coordinate directions.
				These components locate the tip of the vector and they can be interpreted as the fraction of the total force which acts in each of the coordinate directions.
			</p>
      <p>
				Three coordinate directions are needed to map our real three-dimensional world but in this section we will start with two, simpler, two-dimensional orthogonal systems: <term>rectangular</term> and <term>polar</term> coordinates<term>,</term> and the tools to convert from one to the other.

    <subsection xml:id="rectangular-coords">
      <title>Rectangular Coordinates</title>
      <p>
				The most important coordinate system is the <term>Cartesian</term> system, which was named after the French mathematician René Descartes.
				In two dimensions the coordinate axes are straight lines rotated 90<degree/> apart named <m>x</m>, and <m>y</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
				In most cases, the <m>x</m> axis is horizontal and points to the right, and the <m>y</m> axis points vertically upward, however, we are free to rotate or translate this entire coordinate system if we like.
				It is usually mathematically advantageous to establish the origin at a convenient point to make measurements from, and to align one of the coordinate axes with a major feature of the problem.

						You must be careful here and use some common sense.
						The <m>\ang{-30}</m> angle your calculator gives you in this problem is incorrect because point <m>P</m> is in the second quadrant, but your calculator doesn't know this.
						It can't tell whether the argument of <m> \tan^{-1}(-0.577)</m> is negative because the <m>x</m> was negative or because the <m>y</m> was negative, so it must make an assumption and in this case it is wrong.
					</p>
          <p>
						The arctan function on calculators will always return values in the first and fourth quadrant.
						If, by inspection of the <m>x</m> and the <m>y</m> coordinates, you see that the point is in the second or third quadrant, you must add or subtract <m>\ang{180}</m> to the calculator's answer.
					</p>
          <p>
						So in this problem, <m>\theta</m> is really <m>\ang{-30} + \ang{180}</m>.

				In this section we will discuss four methods to specify points and vectors in three-dimensional space.
			</p>
      <p>
				The most commonly used method is an extension of two-dimensional <term>rectangular coordinates</term> to three-dimensions.
				Alternately, points and vectors in three dimensions can be specified in terms of <term>direction cosines</term>, or using <term>spherical</term> or <term>cylindrical</term> coordinate systems.
				These will be discussed in the following sections.
			</p>
      <p>
				You will often need to convert from one representation to another.
				Good visualization skills are helpful here.

      <title>Rectangular Coordinates</title>
      <p>
				We can extend the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system into three dimensions easily by adding a <m>z</m> axis perpendicular to the two-dimensional Cartesian plane.
				The notation is similar to the notation used for two-dimensional vectors.
				Points and forces are expressed as ordered triples of rectangular coordinates following the same notation used previously.

      <title>Direction Cosine Angles</title>
      <p>
				The direction of a vector in two-dimensional systems could be expressed clearly with a single angle measured from a reference axis, but adding an additional dimension means that one angle is no longer enough.
			</p>
      <p>
				One way to define the direction of a three-dimensional vector is by using <term>direction cosine angles</term>, also commonly known as <term>coordinate direction angles</term>.
				The direction cosine angles are the angles between the positive <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> axes to a given vector and are traditionally named <m>\theta_x</m>, <m>\theta_y</m>, and <m>\theta_z</m>.
				Three-dimensional vectors, components, and angles are often difficult to visualize because they do not commonly lie in the Cartesian planes.

        We can relate the components of a vector to its direction cosine angles using the following equations.
        <mdn>
          <mrow xml:id="direction-cosines">
            \cos {\theta_x} \amp = \frac{A_x}{\left |A \right |} \amp \cos \theta_y \amp = \frac {A_y}{\left |A \right |} \amp \cos \theta_z \amp = \frac {A_z}{\left |A \right |}
          </mrow>
        </mdn>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note the component in the numerator of each direction cosine equation is positive or negative as defined by the coordinate system, and the vector magnitude in the denominator is always positive.
				From these equations, we can conclude that:
        <ul>
          <li>
						Direction cosines are signed value between -1 and 1.
					</li>
          <li>
						Direction cosine angles must always be between <m>\ang{0}</m> and <m>\ang{180}</m> or
						<me>
							\ang{0} \le \theta_n \le \ang{180}
						</me>.
					</li>
          <li>
						Any direction cosine angle greater than <m>\ang{90}</m> indicates a negative component along that respective axis.
						Spatially this is because all direction cosine angles are measured from the positive side of each axis.
						Mathematically this is because the cosine of any angle between 90 and 180 degrees is numerically negative.

				A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of one and no units.
				As such, a unit vector represents a pure direction.
				By convention, a unit vector is indicated by a <em>hat</em> over a vector symbol.

				When a purely-directional unit vector is multiplied by a scalar value it is <em>scaled</em> by that amount.
				For example, when a unit vector pointing to the right is multiplied by <m>\N{ 100}</m> the result is a <m>\N{100}</m> vector pointing to the right.
				When a unit vector pointing up is multiplied by <m>\N{ -50}</m>, the negative magnitude flips the direction of the unit vector and the result is a <m>\N{50}</m> vector pointing down.

        <ul>
          <li>
						The signs of unit vector components need to match the signs of the original position vector.
						A unit vector has the same line of action and sense as the position vector but is scaled down to one unit in magnitude.
					</li>
          <li>
						Components of a unit vector must be between -1 and 1.
						If the magnitude of a unit vector is one, then it is impossible for it to have rectangular components larger than one.

        If you look closely at the right side of equation <xref ref="direction-cosines"/>, you will see that each equation consists of a component divided by the total vector magnitude.
				These are the same equations just used to find unit vectors.
				Thus, the cosine of each direction cosine angle collectively also computes the components of the unit vector; hence we can write an equation for <m>\hat{\vec{A}}</m>,

			</p>
      <p>
				These different methods are tools for your statics toolbox.

        All methods of vector addition are ultimately based on the tip-to-tail method discussed in a one-dimensional context in <xref ref="one-dimensional-vector-addition"/>.
				There are two ways to draw or visualize adding vectors in two or three dimensions, the <term>Triangle Rule</term> and <term>Parallelogram Rule</term>.

      <title>Graphical Vector Addition</title>
      <p>
				Graphical vector addition involves drawing a scaled diagram using either the parallelogram or triangle rule, and then measuring the magnitudes and directions from the diagram.
				Graphical solutions work well enough for two-dimensional problems where all the vectors live in the same plane and can be drawn on a sheet of paper, but are not very useful for three-dimensional problems unless you use technology.
			</p>
      <p>
				If you carefully draw the triangle accurately to scale and use a protractor and ruler you can measure the magnitude and direction of the resultant.
				However, your answer will only be as precise as your diagram and your ability to read your tools.
				If you use technology such as GeoGebra or a CAD program to make the diagram, your answer will be precise.
				The interactive in <xref ref="addition-2d-views"/> may be useful for this.
			</p>
      <p>
				Even though the graphical approach has limitations, it is worth your attention because it provides a good way to visualize the effects of multiple forces, to quickly estimate ballpark answers, and to visualize the diagrams you need to use alternate methods to follow.

        Using triangle-based geometry to solve vector problems is a quick and powerful tool, but includes the following limitations:
        <ul>
          <li>
						There are only three sides in a triangle; thus vectors can only be added two at a time.
						If you need to add three or more vectors using this method, you must add the first two, then add the third to that sum and so on.
					</li>
          <li>
						If you fail to draw the correct vector triangle or identify the known sides and angles, you will not find the correct answer.
					</li>
          <li>
						The trigonometric functions produce scalar values.
						You can use them to find the magnitudes the angles between vectors, but the results are not, by themselves, vectors.

        </ul>

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_02-orthogonal-components">
      <title>Orthogonal Components</title>
      <p>
				Any arbitrary two-dimensional vector <m>\vec{F}</m> can be broken into two component vectors which are the sides of a parallelogram having <m>\vec{F}</m> as its diagonal.
				The process of finding components of a vector in particular directions is called <term>vector resolution</term>.
				While a vector can be resolved into components in any two directions, it's generally most useful to resolve them into <term>rectangular</term> or <term>orthogonal</term> components, where the parallelogram is a rectangle and the components are perpendicular.
			</p>
      <p>
				There are an infinite number of possible rectangles to choose from, so each vector has an infinite number of sets of orthogonal components.
				However, the most important set occurs when the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes.
				These orthogonal components are given <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> subscripts indicate that they're aligned with the coordinate axes.
				For vector <m>\vec{F}</m>,
				<men>
					\vec{F} = \vec{F}_x + \vec{F}_y = F_x\ \ihat + F_y\ \jhat
				</men>,
				where <m>F_x</m> and <m>F_y</m> are the scalar components of <m>\vec{F}</m>.
				The advantage of this choice of components is that vector calculations can be replaced with ordinary algebric calculation on scalar values for each orthogonal direction.
			</p>
      <p>
				Alternately, you may rotate the coordinate system to any other convenient angle, and find the components in the directions of the rotated coordinate axes <m>x'</m> and <m>y'</m>.
				In either case, the vector is the sum of the rectangular components
				<men>
					\vec{F} = \vec{F}_x + \vec{F}_y = \vec{F}_{x'} + \vec{F}_{y'}
				</men>.

				While the parallelogram rule and the graphical and trigonometric methods are useful tools for visualizing and finding the sum of two vectors, they are not particularly suited for adding <em>more</em> than two vectors or working in three dimensions.
			</p>
      <p>
				Consider vector <m>\vec{R}</m> which is the sum of several vectors <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{B}</m>, <m>\vec{C}</m> and perhaps more.
				Vectors <m>\vec{A}</m>, <m>\vec{B}</m> and <m>\vec{C}</m> are the components of <m>\vec{R}</m>, and the <m>\vec{R}</m> is the resultant of <m>\vec{A}</m>,<m>\vec{B}</m> and <m>\vec{C}</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
				It is easy enough to say that <m>\vec{R} = \vec{A}+ \vec{B}+ \vec{C}</m>, but how can we calculate <m>\vec{R}</m>? You could draw the vectors arranged tip-to-tail and then use the triangle rule to add the first two components, then use it again to add the third component to that sum, and so forth until all the components have been added.
				The final sum is the resultant, <m>\vec{R}</m>.
				The process gets progressively more tedious the more components there are to sum.
			</p>
      <p>
				This section introduces an alternate method to add multiple vectors which is straightforward, efficient and robust.
				This is called <em>algebraic method</em>, because the vector addition is replaced with a process of <em>algebraic</em> addition of <em>scalar</em> components.
				The algebraic technique works equally well for two and three-dimensional vectors, and for summing any number of vectors.
			</p>
      <p>
        To find the sum of multiple vectors using the algebraic method:
        <ol>
          <li>
						Find the scalar components of each component vector in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions using the P to R procedure described in <xref ref="coord-transformation"/>.
					</li>
          <li>
						Algebraically sum the scalar components in each coordinate direction.
						The scalar components will be positive if they point right or up, negative if they point left or down.
						These sums are the scalar components of the resultant.
					</li>
          <li>
						Resolve the resultant's components to find the magnitude and direction of the resultant vector using the R to P procedure described in <xref ref="coord-transformation"/>.
					</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The resultant <m>\vec{F}_R</m> is the simply the algebraic sum of the components in each coordinate direction.

				Like one-dimensional vector subtraction, the easiest way to handle two-dimensional vector subtraction is by taking the negative of a vector followed by vector addition.
				Multiplying a vector by -1 preserves its magnitude but flips its direction, which has the effect of changing the sign of the scalar components.

				Alternately, the first is referred to as the <term>scalar product</term> because its result is a scalar, and the second as the <term>vector product</term> because its result is a vector.

    <subsection xml:id="vector-projections">
      <title>Vector Projection</title>
      <p>
				The dot product is used to find the <term>projection</term> of one vector onto another.
				You can think of a projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> on <m>\vec{A}</m> as a vector the length of the shadow of <m>\vec{B}</m> on the line of action of <m>\vec{A}</m> when the sun is directly above <m>\vec{A}</m>.
				More precisely, the projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto <m>\vec{A}</m> produces the rectangular component of <m>\vec{B}</m> in the direction <em>parallel</em> to <m>\vec{A}</m>.
				This is one side of a rectangle aligned with <m>\vec{A}</m>, having <m>\vec{B}</m> as its diagonal.
			</p>
      <p>
				This is illustrated in <xref ref="ggb_dot_product"/>, where <m>\vec{u}</m> is the projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto <m>\vec{A}</m>, or alternately <m>\vec{u}</m> is the rectangular component of <m>\vec{B}</m> in the direction of <m>\vec{A}</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
        In this text we will use the symbols
        <ul>
          <li><m>\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B}</m> to mean the <term>vector projection</term> of <m>\vec{B}</m> on <m>\vec{A}</m></li>
          <li><m>|\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B}|</m> to mean the <em>magnitude</em> of the vector projection, a positive or zero-valued scalar, and
					</li>
          <li><m>\|\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B}\|</m> to mean the <term>scalar projection</term>.
						This value represents the component of <m>\vec{B}</m> in the <m>\vec{A}</m> direction, and can have a positive, zero, or negative value.
					</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
				As we have mentioned before, the magnitude of a vector is its length and is always positive or zero, while a scalar component is a signed value that can be positive or negative.
				When a scalar component is multiplied by a unit vector the result is a vector in that direction when the scalar component is positive, or <m>\ang{180}</m> opposite when the scalar component is negative.
			</p>

      <p>
				The interactive shows that the projection is the adjacent side of a right triangle with <m>\vec{B}</m> as the hypotenuse.
				From the definition of the dot product <xref ref="dot-product-2"/> we find that
				<men xml:id="projection-1">\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} = A ( B\ \cos \theta) = A\ \|\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B}\|
				</men>,
				where <m>B\ \cos \theta</m> is the scalar component of the projection.
				So, the dot product of <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> gives us the projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto <m>\vec{A}</m> times the magnitude of <m>\vec{A}</m>.
				This value will be positive when <m>\theta &lt; \ang{90}</m>, negative when <m>\theta &gt; \ang{90}</m>, and zero when the vectors are perpendicular because of the properties of the cosine function.
			</p>
      <p>
				So, to find the scalar value of the projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto <m>\vec{A}</m> we divide by the magnitude of <m>\vec{A}</m>.
				<men xml:id="projection2"> \|\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B} \| =\frac{\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B}}{A}=\frac{\vec{A}}{A} \cdot \vec{B}=\hat{\vec{A}}\cdot \vec{B}
				</men>
				where <m>\hat{\vec{A}}=\dfrac{\vec{A}}{A}</m> is the unit vector in the dirction of <m>\vec{A}</m>.
			</p>
      <p>
				If you want the <em>vector</em> projection of <m>\vec{B}</m> onto <m>\vec{A}</m>, as opposed to the <em>scalar</em> projection we just found, multiply the <em>scalar</em> projection by the unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{A}}</m>.
				<men xml:id="projection3">\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B} = \|\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B} \| \hat{\vec{A}} = \left (\hat{\vec{A}} \cdot \vec{B} \right )\hat{\vec{A}}
				</men></p>
      <p>
				Similarly, the vector projection of <m>\vec{A}</m> onto <m>\vec{B}</m> is
				<men>
					\proj_{\vec{B}}\vec{A} = \|\proj_{\vec{B}}\vec{A} \| \hat{\vec{B}} ={\left (\vec{A} \cdot \hat{\vec{B}} \right )\hat{\vec{B}}}
				</men></p>
      <p>
        The spatial interpretation of the results the scalar projection <m>\|\proj_{\vec{A}}\vec{B} \|</m> is

      <p>
				The vector <term>cross product</term> is a multipliation operation applied to two vectors which produces a third mutually perpendicular vector as a result.
				It's sometimes called the <term>vector product</term> to emphasize this and to distinguish it from the dot product which produces a scalar result.
				The <m>\times</m> symbol is used to indicate this operation.
			</p>
      <p>
				Cross products are used in mechanics to find the moment of a force about a point.

      <p>
				The cross product is a vector multiplication process defined by
				<men xml:id="cross-product-def">\vec{A} \times \vec{B}= A \; B \sin \theta \; \hat{\vec{u}}
				</men>.
				The result is a vector mutually perpendicular to both with a sense determined by the right-hand rule.
				If <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> are in the <m>xy</m> plane, this is
				<men xml:id="cross-product-det"> \vec{A} \times \vec{B}=(A_y B_x - A_x B_y)\ \khat
				</men>.
				The operation is not commutative, in fact reversing the order introduces a negative sign.
				<me>
					\vec{A}\times \vec{B}= - \vec{B} \times \vec{A}
				</me>.
			</p>
      <p>
				The magnitude of the cross product is the product of the perpendicular component of <m>\vec{A}</m> with the magnitude of <m>\vec{B},</m>.
				This is the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m>.
				The magnitude of the cross product is zero if <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> are parallel, and it is maximum when they are perpendicular.
				The magnitude of the cross product of two perpendicular <em>unit</em> vectors is one.
			</p>
      <p>
				Notice that the cross product equation are similar to the dot product, except that <m>\sin</m> is used rather than <m>\cos</m> and the product includes a unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> making the result a vector.
				This unit vector <m>\hat{\vec{u}}</m> is simple to find in a two-dimensional problem as it will always be perpendicular to the page, but for three-dimensional cross products a vector determinant is used, as discussed in <xref ref="vector-cross-products"/>.

      <p>
				The direction of a cross product is determined by the <term>right-hand rule.</term> There are two ways to apply the right-hand rule, the three-finger method, and the point-and-curl method.
				You don't need both, but you will need to master at least one to find the direction of cross products.
			</p>
      <p>
				The three-finger method uses the fact that your extended index finger, middle finger, and thumb are all roughly mutually perpendicular.
				If you align your index finger with the first vector and your middle finger with the second, then your thumb will point in the direction of the cross product.
				Alternately, if you align your thumb with the first vector and your index finger with the second, your middle finger will point in the direction of the cross-product.

      <title>Cross Product of Arbitrary Vectors</title>
      <p>
				The cross product of two arbitrary three-dimensional vectors can be calculated by evaluating the <term>determinant</term> of this <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix.
				<men xml:id="cross-product-1"> \vec{A} \times \vec{B} = \begin{vmatrix} \ihat \amp \jhat \amp \khat \\ A_x \amp A_y \amp A_z \\ B_x \amp B_y \amp B_z \end{vmatrix}
				</men></p>
      <p>
				Here, the first row contains the unit vectors, the second row contains the components of <m>\vec{A}</m>, and the third row, the components of <m>\vec{B}</m>.
				The determinant of this <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix is evaluated using the method of cofactors, as follows
				<men>
					\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = +\begin{vmatrix} A_y \amp A_z \\ B_y \amp B_z \end{vmatrix} \ \ihat -\begin{vmatrix} A_x \amp A_z \\ B_x \amp B_z \end{vmatrix}\ \jhat +\begin{vmatrix} A_x \amp A_y \\ B_x \amp B_y \end{vmatrix}\ \khat
				</men>.
				Each term contains a <m>2 \times 2</m> determinant which is evaluated with the formula
				<men>
					\begin{vmatrix} a \amp b \\ c \amp d\end{vmatrix} = a d - b c
				</men>.
			</p>
      <p>
				After simplifying, the resulting formula for a three-dimensional cross product is
				<men xml:id="cross-product-2">\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = (A_y B_z - A_z B_y)\ \ihat - ( A_x B_z - A_z B_x)\ \jhat + (A_x B_y - A_y B_x)\ \khat
				</men>.
			</p>
      <p>
				In practice, the easiest way to remember this equation is to use the augmented determinant below, where the first two columns have been copied and placed after the determinant.
				The cross product is then calculated by adding the product of the red diagonals and subtracting the product of blue diagonals.
				The result is identical to  <xref ref="cross-product-2"/>.

				In two dimensions, vectors <m>\vec{A}</m> and <m>\vec{B}</m> have no <m>z</m> components, so <xref ref="cross-product-2"/> reduces to
