<span class="heading"><span class="title">Break the overall shape into simpler parts.</span></span><div class="para">We begin with a sketch of the shape and establish a coordinate system. It is critical that all measurements are made from a common origin, and the results will be measured from this origin as well. A careful choice of origin can simplify the problem, so give it some thought.</div>
<div class="para">Then divide the shape into several simpler shapes. The sub-shapes may include holes, which are treated as negative areas. You must know how to calculate the area and locate the centroid of any sub-shape you use.</div>
<div class="para">Consider the complex shape below.</div>
<div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/images/composite-ex-0.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="A rectangle has its bottom left corner at the origin, and top right at (5, 4). The left side of a right triangle of height 4 cm and width 6 cm is flush with the right side of the rectangle. A circle of r = 1.5 cm is cut out of the rectangle, with it’s center at (3, 2)."></div>
<div class="para">There are often several ways to divide a shape, but it’s best to use as few parts as possible to minimize your computations and opportunities for error. For example, you could choose to break this shape into either a <span class="process-math">\(\cm{5} \times \cm{4}\)</span> rectangle, a <span class="process-math">\(\cm{6} \times \cm{4}\)</span> right triangle, and an <span class="process-math">\(r = \cm{1.5}\)</span> circular hole,</div>
<div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/images/composite-ex-1.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Rectangle plus triangle minus circle"></div>
<div class="para">or a large <span class="process-math">\(\cm{11} \times \cm{4}\)</span> rectangle, an <span class="process-math">\(r = \cm{1.5}\)</span> circular hole, and a <span class="process-math">\(\cm{6} \times \cm{4}\)</span> right triangle subtracted from the large rectangle.</div>
<div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/images/composite-ex-2.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Rectangle of width 11 cm and height 4 cm minus right triangle with vertices at (5,4) and (11,0) minus circle."></div>
<div class="para">Both options will give the same results, and in this case there is no particular advantage to one choice over the other. However, it would be silly and unnecessary to break this into more than three parts, and it would not be a good idea to divide this into a trapezoid minus a hole, unless you know geometric properties of a trapezoid, which are not available in <a href="Chapter_07-centroids.html#centroid-table" class="internal" title="Subsection 7.4.1: Properties of Common Shapes">Subsection 7.4.1</a>. Be sure your sub-shapes don’t overlap and don’t get counted more than once.</div>
<div class="para"></div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Collect the areas and centroid coordinates.</span></span><div class="para">Once the complex shape has been divided into parts, the next step is to determine the area and centroidal coordinates for each part. You can use the properties in <a href="Chapter_07-centroids.html#centroid-table" class="internal" title="Subsection 7.4.1: Properties of Common Shapes">Subsection 7.4.1</a> for rectangles, triangles, circles, semi-circles and quarter circles but you will need to use integration if other shapes are involved. Any holes or removed shapes should be treated as negative areas.</div>
<div class="para">Record the information you gather in a table like the one below. The table should include a row containing column headings and units, one row for each part, and a summary row. The first column identifies the part — by number or sketch, the second contains the areas, and the third and fourth contains the centroidal coordinates of the parts.</div>
