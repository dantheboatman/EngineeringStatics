Everything except the floor is now included as our body; only the floor is excluded. The floor was in contact with the other objects at the ground and also at the connection between the floor and the wall.</div> <div class="para">Since we don’t know how the wall and the floor are connected we will assume they were fixed together. We also have to model how the wall is attached to the rest of the world. The fixed support from wall-to-world and wall-to-floor can be combined to be a single set of three loads which we represent as horizontal and vertical forces <span class="process-math">\(V_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_y\text{,}\)</span> and a concentrated moment <span class="process-math">\(M_v\text{.}\)</span>

This representation is really a simplification of the actual situation since the force of the floor is really distributed over the bottom surface of the block; however, this simplification is justified in much the same way as we represent the weight of an object as a single force acting at its center of gravity.</div> <article class="assemblage assemblage-like"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Tips.</span></h6>
