  <title>Introduction to Statics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Engineering Statics is the gateway into <em>engineering mechanics</em>, which is the application of Newtonian physics to design and analyze objects, systems, and structures with respect to motion, deformation, and failure.
      In addition to learning the subject itself, you will also develop skills in the art and practice of problem solving and mathematical modeling, skills that will benefit you throughout your engineering career.</p>
    <p>The subject is called <q>statics</q> because it is concerned with particles and rigid bodies that are in equilibrium, and these will usually be stationary,
        <ie/>
        static.</p>
    <p>
      The chapters in this book are:
      <ul marker="">
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_01" text="title"/><mdash/> an overview of statics and an introduction to units and problem solving.</li>
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_02" text="title"/><mdash/> basic principles and mathematical operations on force and position vectors.</li>
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_03" text="title"/><mdash/> an introduction to equilibrium and problem solving.</li>
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_04" text="title"/><mdash/> the rotational tendency of forces, and simplification of force systems.</li>
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_05" text="title"/><mdash/> balance of forces and moments for single rigid bodies.</li>
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_06" text="title"/><mdash/> balance of forces and moments on interconnected systems of rigid bodies.</li>
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_07" text="title"/><mdash/> an important geometric property of shapes and rigid bodies.</li>
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_08" text="title"/><mdash/> forces and moments within beams and other rigid bodies.</li>
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_09" text="title"/><mdash/> equilibrium of bodies subject to friction.</li>
        <li><xref ref="Chapter_10" text="title"/><mdash/> an important property of geometric shapes used in many applications.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Your statics course may not cover all of these topics, or may move through them in a different order.</p>
    <p>Below are two examples of the types of problems you'll learn to solve in statics.
			Notice that each can be described with a picture and problem statement, a free-body diagram, and equations of equilibrium.</p>

				Calculus and Physics are the foundation to be able to learn engineering statics.
				The "Engineering Mechanics Trilogy" is encircled, and the relationships described between the three subjects - statics, dynamics, and solids.
				Statics is depicted as "no movement".
				Dynamics is depicted as "Hold on.
				Everything is moving." Solids is depicted as "it's what inside that counts".
				After learning statics, you will move to Solids (mechanics of materials) by learning about shear and moment, frames, and virtual work.
				Also from the fundamentals of statics you will move to Dynamics, where you will learn more about friction and machines.
				A common thread between all three subjects is includes equilibrium, moment of inertia, and centroids.
				Additional content that you'll add to your Statics knowledge in Solids includes: stress and strain, material properties, and torsion.
				Additional content you'll add to your
				Statics knowledge in Dynamics is the concept that the sum of the forces is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration and that this is NOT equal to zero, as it is in Statics.
				You will also learn about motion and accelerations.</shortdescription>

        <li>What are the two types of motion?</li>
        <li>What three relationships do Newton's laws of motion define?</li>
        <li>What are physical examples for each of Newton's three laws of motion?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The English scientist Sir Issac Newton established the foundation of mechanics in 1687 with his three laws of motion, which describe the relation between forces, objects and motion.
				Motion can be separated into two types:
        <ul marker="">
          <li>
            <p><term>Translation</term><mdash/> where a body changes position without changing its orientation in space, and</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><term>Rotation</term><mdash/> where a body spins about an axis fixed in space, without changing its average position.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Some moving bodies are purely translating, others are purely rotating, and many are doing both.
				Conveniently, we can usually separate translation and rotation and analyze them individually with independent equations.</p>
      <p>Newton's three laws and their implications with respect to translation and rotation are described below.</p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="newtons-first-law">
      <title>Newton's 1st Law</title>
      <p>Newton's first law states that</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force</em>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This law, also sometimes called the <q>law of inertia,</q> tells us that bodies maintain their current velocity unless a net force is applied to change it.
				In other words, an object at rest it will remain at rest and a moving object will hold its current speed and direction unless an unbalanced force causes a velocity change.
				Remember that velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction, so an unbalanced force may cause an object to speed up, slow down, or change direction.</p>

      <p>Newton's first law also applies to angular velocities, however instead of force, the relevant quantity which causes an object to rotate is called a <term>torque</term> by physicists, but usually called a <term>moment</term> by engineers.
				A moment, as you will learn in <xref ref="Chapter_04"/>, is the rotational tendency of a force.
				Just as a force will cause a change in linear velocity, a moment will cause a change in angular velocity.
				This can be seen in things like tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other objects that spin on an axis when a moment is applied, but eventually stop because of the opposite moment produced by friction.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="newtons-second-law">
      <title>Newton's 2nd Law</title>
      <p>Newton's second law is usually succinctly stated with the familiar equation</p>
      <p><men xml:id="second-law">\vec{F} = m \vec{a}</men>
				where <m>\vec{F}</m> is net force, <m>m</m> is mass, and <m>\vec{a}</m> is acceleration.</p>
      <p>You will notice that the force and the acceleration are in bold face.
				This means these are vector quantities, having both a magnitude and a direction.
				Mass on the other hand is a scalar quantity, which has only a magnitude.
				This equation indicates that a force will cause an object to accelerate in the direction of the net force, and the magnitude of the acceleration will be proportional to the net force but inversely proportional to the mass of the object.</p>
      <p>When studying Statics we are only concerned with bodies which are <em>not</em> accelerating which simplifies things considerably.
				When an object is not accelerating <m>a = 0</m>, which implies that it is either at rest or moving with a constant velocity.
				With this restriction Newton's Second Law for translation simplifies to</p>
      <p><men>\Sigma \vec{F}=0</men>
				where <m>\Sigma \vec{F}</m> is read as <q>the sum of the forces</q> and used to indicate the <em>net</em> force acting on the object.</p>
      <p>Newton's second law for rotational motions is similar</p>
      <p><men xml:id="second-law-rotation">\vec{M} =I \boldsymbol{\alpha}</men>.
				This equation states that a net moment <m>\vec{M}</m> acting on an object will cause an angular acceleration <m>\boldsymbol{\alpha}</m> proportional to the net moment and inversely proportional to <m>I</m>, a quantity known as the <term>mass moment of inertia.</term> Mass moment of inertia for rotational acceleration is analogous to ordinary mass for linear acceleration.
				We will have more to say about the moment of inertia in <xref ref="Chapter_10"/>.</p>
      <p>Again, we see that the net moment and angular acceleration are vectors, quantities with magnitude and direction.
				The mass moment of inertia, on the other hand, is a scalar quantity and has only a magnitude.
				Also, since Statics deals only with objects which are <em>not</em> accelerating <m>\boldsymbol{\alpha} = 0</m>, they will always be at rest or rotating with constant angular velocity.
				With this restriction Newton's second law implies that the net moment on all static objects is zero.</p>
      <p><men>\Sigma \vec{M}=0</men></p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="newtons-third-law">
      <title>Newton's 3rd Law</title>
      <p>Newton's Third Law states</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The actions and reactions Newton is referring to are <term>forces</term>.
				Forces occur whenever one object interacts with another, either directly like a push or pull, or indirectly like magnetic or gravitational attraction.
				Any force acting on one body is always paired with another equal-and-opposite force acting on some other body.</p>

      <p>These equal-and-opposite pairs can be confusing, particularly when there are multiple interacting bodies.
				To clarify, we always begin solving statics problems by drawing a <term>free-body diagram</term><mdash/> a sketch where we isolate a body or system of interest and identify the forces acting <em>on</em> it, while ignoring any forces exerted <em>by</em> it on interacting bodies.</p>
      <p>Consider the situation in <xref ref="table_book"/>.
				Diagram (a) shows a book resting on a table supported by the floor.
				The weights of the book and table are placed at their centers of gravity.
				To solve for the forces on the legs of the table, we use the free-body diagram in (b) which treats the book and the table as a single system and replaces the floor with the forces of the floor <em>on</em> the table.
				In diagram (c) the book and table are treated as independent objects.
				By separating them, the equal-and-opposite interaction forces of the book <em>on</em> the table and the table <em>on</em> the book are exposed.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>What are the similarities and differences between the SI, British Gravitational, and English Engineering unit systems?</li>
        <li>How do you convert a value into different units?</li>
        <li>When a Statics problem give a value in pounds, is this referring to pounds-force or pounds-mass?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <introduction>
      <p>Engineering quantities consist of a numeric value and an associated unit (like <m>\kg{150}</m>, <m>\aSI{9.81}</m>, or <m>\ft{17}</m>). The values by themselves (150, 9.81, or 17) are just numbers, but the units give the numbers context. When discussing a quantity, you must <em>always</em> include the associated unit. The exceptions to this rule are unitless quantities, which are typically ratios where the units all cancel out.</p>
      <p>
        Related units are defined as a coherent <term>unit system</term>. All unit systems are based on seven base units, the important ones for Statics being mass, length, and time. These base units combine to form all other measurement units. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>Acceleration is defined as length <m>[L]</m> divided by time <m>[t]</m> squared, so has units	<m>a =[L/t^2]</m></li>
          <li>Force is the product of mass and acceleration, as defined by <xref ref="second-law" text="custom">Newton's second law</xref>, so the units of force are <m>F= [m L/t^2]</m>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_01-unit-systems">
      <title>Unit Systems</title>
      <p>Multiple unit systems are generally used in engineering practice in the United States, including the SI and British Gravitational systems. A third, the English Engineering system, is commonly only used in Physics applications.</p>
      <p>The SI system, abbreviated from the French <foreign>Système International (d'unités)</foreign> is the modern form of the metric system. The SI system is used for most international engineering and  increasingly used in the U.S. in  fields like science, medicine, electronics, and the military.</p>
      <p>In the SI system, the unit of force is the <term>newton</term>, abbreviated <m>N</m>, and the unit of mass is the <term>kilogram</term>, abbreviated kg. The base unit of time, used by all systems, is the <term>second</term>, abbreviated s. Prefixes are added to unit names are used to specify the base-10 multiple of the original unit. One newton is equal to <m>\mathrm{1\ kg \cdot m}/\mathrm{s}^2</m> because <m>\N{1}</m> of force applied to <m>\kg{1}</m> of mass causes the mass to accelerate at a rate of <m>\aSI{1}</m>.</p>
      <p>The other unit systems, British Gravitational and English Engineering, fall under the general name of <q>Imperial units,</q> given their broad use in the British Empire. The British Gravitational system uses the <term>foot</term>, abbreviated ft, as the base unit of distance, the <term>second</term> for time, and the <term>slug</term> for mass. Force is expressed in the unit of <term>pound-force</term>, abbreviated lbf, or lb for short. One pound-force will accelerate a mass of one slug at <m>\aUS{1}</m>, so <m>\lbf{1} = \mathrm{1\ slug \cdot ft}/\mathrm{s}^2</m>. On earth, a 1 slug mass weighs <m>\lbf{32.174}</m>.</p>
      <p>The English Engineering system also uses <term>foot</term> as the base unit of distance and <term>second</term> for time, but, unlike the British Gravitational system, uses <term>pound-mass</term> as the base unit of mass, where <me>\lbm{32.174} = 1 \mathrm{\ slug} = \kg{14.6}</me>.</p>
      <p>While gravitational acceleration remains the same between the British Gravitational and English Engineering systems, a conversion factor is required to maintain unit consistency.
        <men xml:id="lbm_slug">1= \left[\frac { 1\ \mathrm{lbf} \cdot \mathrm{s}^2}{ 32.174\ \mathrm{ft}\cdot \mathrm{lbm}}\right] = \left[ \frac{1\ \mathrm{slug}}{32.174\ \mathrm{lbm}} \right]</men></p>
      <p>The perceived advantage of the English Engineering system is that on Earth, a mass of <m>\lbm{1}</m> weighs <m>\lbf{1}</m>. However, this numerical equivalence often causes confusion, given the required gravitational conversion factor mentioned in the previous paragraph and the simple fact that mass and weight are different. Mass describes how much matter an object contains, while weight is a force <mdash/> the effect of gravity on a mass.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the U.S. engineering community primarily embraces the British Gravitational system but avoids the mass unit of slugs, instead stating material amounts as weight in pounds-force, or for brevity, pounds.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_01-units-within-newtons-2nd-law">
      <title>Units within Newton's 2nd Law</title>
      <p>Given that Newton's 2nd Law, <m>\Sigma \vec{F} = m \vec{a}</m>, is one of the foundational equations in engineering mechanics and the most basic equation relating mass and weight, let’s examine its use in more detail. First we need to relate <m>\Sigma \vec{F} = m \vec{a}</m> to weight, mass, and gravity. Consider an object in free fall. The only vertical force on the body is its weight <m>W</m>; thus, the object’s mass <m>m</m> is accelerated by gravity <m>g</m>. Therefore, we can tranform Newton's 2nd Law <m>\Sigma \vec{F} = m \vec{a}</m> to <m>\vec{W} = m \vec{g}</m>.</p>
      <p>
        The scalar version, <m>W=mg</m>, also serves as the conversion equation among weight, mass, and gravity. You likely know this  relationship for problems using the SI system. Hence, if you are given a <m>\kg{100}</m> object here on earth and are asked to find the weight, you compute:
        <md>
          <mrow>W \amp = mg</mrow>
          <mrow>W \amp = \kg{100}\ (\aSI{9.81})</mrow>
          <mrow>W \amp = \N{981}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        The confusion often starts when students in the United States are asked to find the mass of a known-weight object. Let's say you are asked to find the mass of a <m>\lb{100}</m> object. Given the U.S. engineering convention that all pounds are force, the <m>lb</m> unit listed in the problem is pounds-force. Here's the root of the confusion: <alert>SI problems give an object’s mass, while U.S. problems give an object’s weight</alert>. Life would be easier if this was not the case, but never fear <mdash/> we can use <m>W=mg</m> to solve the problem. This time we will solve for <m>m</m> instead of <m>W</m>.
        <md>
          <mrow>W \amp = mg</mrow>
          <mrow>\lb{100} \amp = m\ \aUS{32.2}</mrow>
          <mrow>m \amp = \frac{\lb{100}}{\aUS{32.2}}</mrow>
          <mrow>m \amp = 3.1\ \mathrm{slug}</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>Next we will investigate the values of the gravitational acceleration constant in SI and the British Gravitational system. As both measure the acceleration of an object toward the Earth, it should make sense that they are equivalent:
        <me>g=\aSI{9.81}\left (\frac{\ft{3.28}}{\m{1}}\right ) \approx \aUS{32.2}</me>
      As shown in this unit conversion, <em>always make sure to multiply terms by the correct ratios</em> to get your desired units. In this case we multipled by (<m>\ft{3.28} / \m{1}</m>) with meters in the bottom so it cancels out with the meters in the top of <m>\aSI{9.81}</m>.</p>
      <p>Here are two examples to test your understanding of the relationships among weight, mass, and gravity.</p>

      <title>Avoiding Common Unit Errors</title>
      <p>
        Awareness of units will help you prevent errors in your engineering calculations.
        You should always:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pay attention to the units of every quantity in the problem. Forces should have force units, distances should have distance units,
            <etc/>
          </li>
          <li>Use the unit system given in the problem statement and ensure any constants used agree with the units of the other terms. For example, <m>g=\aSI{9.81}</m> should only be used when the rest of the problem is in SI units, matching the units of m and s.</li>
          <li>Avoid unit conversions when possible. If you must, convert given values to a consistent set of units and stick with them.</li>
          <li>Ensure unit consistency in your calculations. You can only add or subtract quantities with the same units. When multiplying or dividing quantities with units, apply the same operation to the units. Finally, the units on both sides of an equation must match.</li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Develop a sense of the magnitudes of the units and consider your answers for reasonableness. On Earth, the four commonly used masses and weights, from smallest to largest, are roughly equivalent to:
              <ul marker="">
                <li>Newton = 1 apple,</li>
                <li>pound-force = box of butter,</li>
                <li>kilogram = a pineapple, and</li>
                <li>slug = a medium dog (like a Corgi).</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>Assume every answer in Statics, and engineering in general, has units. A few answers will be dimensionless, but not many.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Understanding the relationship between weight, mass, and gravitational acceleration is essential for solving Statics problems. Always identify whether weight or mass is given and use <m>W=mg</m> with the correct gravitational acceleration. This intentional process will help you confidently work across both SI and U.S. unit systems.</p>

        <li>What are some of the fundamental types of forces used in statics?</li>
        <li>Why do we often simplify distributed forces with equivalent point forces?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>Statics is a course about forces and we will have a lot to say about them.
			At its simplest, a force is a <q>push or pull,</q> but forces come from a variety of sources and occur in many different situations.
			As such we need a specialized vocabulary to talk about them.
			We are also interested in forces that cause rotation, and we have special terms to describe these too.</p>
    <p>Some terms used to describe forces are given below; others will be defined as needed later in the book.</p>
    <p><term>Point Forces</term>, also called <term>concentrated forces</term>, are forces that act at a single point.
			Examples are the push you give to open a door, the thrust of a rocket engine, or the pull a the chain suspending a wrecking ball.
			Point forces are actually an idealization, because real forces always act over an area and not at a mathematical point.
			However, point forces are the easiest type to deal with computationally so we will usually represent other types of forces as equivalent concentrated forces.</p>
    <p><term>Distributed forces</term> are forces that are spread out over a line, area or volume.
			Steam pressure in a boiler and the weight of snow on a roof are examples of forces distributed over an area.
			Distributed forces are represented graphically by an array of force vectors.</p>
    <p><term>Body forces</term> are distributed forces acting over the volume of a body.
			The most common body force is the body's weight, but there are others including buoyancy and forces caused by electric and magnetic fields.
			Weight and buoyancy will be the only body forces we consider in this book.</p>
    <p>In many situations, body forces are small in comparison to the other forces acting on the object, and as such may be neglected.
			In practice, the decision to neglect forces must be made on the basis of sound engineering judgment; however, in this course you should consider the weight in your analysis if the problem statement provides enough information to determine it, otherwise you may ignore it.</p>
    <p><term>Loads</term> are the forces which an object must support in order to perform its function.
			Loads can be either static or dynamic, however only static loads will be considered here.
			Forces which hold a loaded object in equilibrium or hold parts of an object together are not considered loads.</p>
    <p><term>Reaction forces</term> or simply <term>reactions</term> are the forces and moments which hold or constrain an object or mechanical system in equilibrium.
			They are called the reactions because they react when other forces on the system change.
			If the load on a system increases, the reaction forces will automatically increase in response to maintain equilibrium.
			Reaction forces are introduced in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/> and reaction moments are introduced in <xref ref="Chapter_05"/>.</p>
    <p><term>Internal forces</term> are forces which hold the parts an object or system together.
			Internal forces will be discussed in <xref ref="Chapter_08"/>.</p>
    <p>As an example of the various types of forces, consider a heavy crate being pulled by a rope across a rough surface.</p>

    <p>The pull of the rope and the weight of the crate are <em>loads</em>.
			The rope applies a force at a single point, so is a <em>concentrated force</em>.
			The force of the ground holding the crate in equilibrium is a <em>reaction force</em>.
			This force can be divided into two components: a <term>tangential</term> friction component which acts parallel to the ground and resists the pull of the cable, and a <term>normal</term> component which acts perpendicular to the bottom surface and supports the crate's weight.
			The normal and tangential components are <em>distributed forces</em> since they act over the bottom surface area.
			The weight is also a distributed force, but one that acts over the entire crate so it's considered a <em>body force</em>.
			For computational simplicity we usually model all these distributed forces as equivalent concentrated forces.
			This process is discussed in <xref ref="Chapter_07"/>.</p>

        <li>What are some strategies to practice selecting a tool from your problem-solving toolbox?</li>
        <li>What is the basic problem-solving process for equilibrium?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>Statics may be the first course you take where you are required to decide on your own how to approach a problem.
			Unlike your previous Physics courses, you can't just memorize a formula and plug-and-chug to get an answer; there are often multiple ways to solve a problem, not all of them equally easy, so before you begin you need a plan or strategy.
			This seems to cause a lot of students difficulty.</p>
    <p>The ways to think about forces, moments and equilibrium, and the mathematics used to manipulate them are like tools in your toolbox.
			Solving statics problems requires acquiring, choosing, and using these tools.
			Some problems can be solved with a single tool, while others require multiple tools.
			Sometimes one tool is a better choice, sometimes another.
			You need familiarity and practice to get skilled using your tools.
			As your skills and understanding improve, it gets easier to recognize the most efficient way to get a job done.</p>
    <p>Struggling statics students often say things like:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><q>I don't know where to start the problem.</q></p>
      <p><q>It looks so easy when you do it.</q></p>
      <p><q>If I only knew which equation to apply, I could solve the problem.</q></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These statements indicate that the students think they know how to use their tools, but are skipping the planning step.
			They jump right to writing equations and solving for things without making much progress towards the answer, or they start solving the problem using a reasonable approach but abandon it in mid-stream to try something else.
			They get lost, confused and give up.</p>
    <p>
      Choosing a strategy gets easier with experience.
			Unfortunately, the way you get that experience is to solve problems.
			It seems like a chicken and egg problem and it is, but there are ways around it.
			Here are some suggestions which will help you become a better problem-solver.
      <ul>
        <li>Get fluent with the math skills from algebra and trigonometry.</li>
        <li>Do lots of problems, starting with simple ones to build your skills.</li>
        <li>Study worked out solutions, however don't assume that just because you understand how someone else solved a problem that you can do it yourself without help.</li>
        <li>Solve problems using multiple approaches.
					Confirm that alternate approaches produce the same results, and try to understand why one method was easier than the other.</li>
        <li>Draw neat, clear, labeled diagrams.</li>
        <li>Familiarize yourself with the application, assumptions, and terminology of the methods covered in class and the textbook.</li>
        <li>When confused, identify what is confusing you and ask questions.</li>
      </ul>

      The majority of the topics in this book focus on equilibrium.
			The remaining topics are either preparing you for solving equilibrium problems or setting you up with skills that you will use in later classes.
			For equilibrium problems, the problem-solving steps are:
      <ol>
        <li>Read and understand the problem.</li>
        <li>Identify what you are asked to find and what is given.</li>
        <li>Stop, think, and decide on an strategy.</li>
        <li>Draw a free-body diagram and define variables.</li>
        <li>Apply the strategy to solve for unknowns and check solutions.</li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Write equations of equilibrium based on the free-body diagram.</li>
              <li>Check if the number of equations equals the number of unknowns.
								If it doesn't, you are missing something.
								You may need additional free-body diagrams or other relationships.</li>
              <li>Solve for unknowns.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Conceptually check solutions.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Using these steps does not guarantee that you will get the right solution, but it will help you be critical and conscious of your chosen strategies.
			This reflection will help you learn more quickly and increase the odds that you choose the right tool for the job.</p>
