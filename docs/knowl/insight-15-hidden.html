You will find that bending the ruler around the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis while it’s flat is easy compared to bending it the other way, around the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis. Why is it easier to bend the ruler one way than the other? It’s the same object, made of the same material either way.</div> <div class="para">The answer has to due with the moment of inertia, and how it relates to the bending axis.</div>  <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="external/images/MOI-ruler.png" class="contained"></div>
