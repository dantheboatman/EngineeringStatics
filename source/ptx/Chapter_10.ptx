  <title>Moments of Inertia</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
			Area moments of inertia are a measure of the distribution of a two-dimensional area around a particular axis.
			Fundamentally, the portions of a shape which are located farther from the axis have a greater affect than the parts which are closer.
			The primary application is in structural engineering and machine design where they are used to determine a structural member's stiffness.
			Another application is in Fluid Mechanics where they are used to determine the effect of pressure on a submerged surface.
			We will use the symbol <m>I</m> for this property, along with a subscript to indicate the specific axis, so for example, <m>I_x</m> would indicate the <q>Area moment of inertia with respect to the <m>x</m> axis.</q></p>
    <warning>
      <p>
				The <em>mass</em> moment of inertia you learned about in Physics is not the same as the <m>area</m> moment of inertia in Statics!
			</p>
      <p>
				This can be confusing since both are commonly shortened to <q>moment of inertia</q> and both use the same symbol, <m>I</m>.
				They have different units however, and the intended moment of inertia can easily be determined from context or with a unit analysis.

    <introduction>
      <p>
				As you know, two dimensional shapes like rectangles and circles have properties such as area, perimeter, and centroid.
				These are purely <em>geometric</em> properties since they belong to the shape alone, in contrast to <em>physical</em> properties like weight and mass which belong to real physical objects.
			</p>
      <p>
				In this section we introduce several new geometric properties useful in engineering including the <term>Area Moment of Inertia</term>.
			</p>
      <p>
				The integral properties of shapes, along with the names and symbols commonly used to represent them are given in the table below.
				You are already familiar with <em>area</em> from Geometry and the <em>first moment of area</em> from <xref ref="Chapter_07"/>.
				The remaining properties are the subject of this chapter.
				They all have a similar form, and can be evaluated using similar integration techniques.

				The differential element <m>dA</m> is an infinitesimally tiny rectangle centered about point <m>(x,y)</m>, which can range over the entire area.
				The distances to the element from the <m>y</m> axis, the <m>x</m> axis and the origin are designated <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>r</m> respectively.

				All of these properties are defined as integrals over an area <m>A</m>.
				These integrals may be evaluated by double-integrating over <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in Cartesian coordinates or <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> in polar coordinates.
				They can also be evaluated using single integration using the methods demonstrated in <xref ref="MOI-triangle"/>.
			</p>
      <p>
				None of these integrals can be evaluated until a specific shape is chosen.
				When shape has been specified, the bounding functions and integration limits can be determined and only then may the integral be solved using appropriate integration techniques.
				If the shape is specified in general terms, say a rectangle with base <m>b</m> and height <m>h</m>, then the result of the integration will be a formula for the property applicable to all similar shapes.

				The first moment of area with respect to an axis is a measure of the distribution of the shape about an axis.
				It depends on the shape and also its location on the coordinate plain.
				Portions of area on the negative side of the selected axis make the first moment smaller, while areas on the positive side make it larger.
				If the shape's centroid is located exactly on the axis, the integral will sum to zero because the contributions of area above and below the axis cancel each other.

      </p>
      <p>
				As you can see, these equations are similar to the equations for the <xref ref="first-moment">first moment of area</xref>, except that the distance terms <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are now squared.
				In recognition of the similarity, the area moments of inertia are also known as the <term>second moments of area</term>.
				We will use the terms moment of inertia and second moment interchangeably.
				These two quantities are sometimes designated as <em>rectangular</em> moments of inertia to distinguish them from the polar moment of inertia described in the next section.
			</p>
      <p>
				Like the first moment, the second moment of area provides a measure of the distribution of area around an axis, but in this case the distance to each element is squared.
				This gives increased importance to portions of the area which are far from the axis.
				Squaring the distance means that identical elements on opposite sides of the axis <em>both</em> contribute to the sum rather than cancel each other out as they do in the first moment.
				As a result, the moment of inertia is always a positive quantity.
			</p>
      <p>
				Two identical shapes can have completely different moments of inertia, depending on how the shape is distributed around the axis.
				A shape with most of its area close to the axis has a smaller moment of inertia than the same shape would if its area was distributed farther from the axis.
				This is a non-linear effect, because when the distance term is doubled, the contribution of that element to the sum increases fourfold.

						Although the areas of all three triangles are the same, triangle <m>B</m> has the area on both sides of the <m>y</m> axis and relatively close to it, and so has the smallest <m>I</m>, while triangle <m>C</m> has the most of its area far from the <m>y</m> axis which makes its moment of inertia largest.

					</p>
        </solution>
      </question>
      <p>
				Moving a shape away from the axis (or moving the axis away from the shape) increases its moment of inertia, and moving it closer to the axis decreases it, until it crosses to the other side of the axis, and then its moment of inertia will begin to increase again.
			</p>
      <p>
				The minimum moment of inertia occurs when the centroid of the shape falls on the axis.
				When this occurs, the moment of inertia is called the <term>centroidal moment of inertia.
				</term> A bar over the symbol <m>I</m> is used to indicate that a moment of inertia is centroidal.
				So for example, <m>\bar{I}_x</m> and <m>\bar{I}_y</m> represent the <q>centroidal moment of inertia with respect to the <m>x</m> axis</q> and the <q> the centroidal moment of inertia with respect to the <m>y</m> axis.</q> The bar in this case does not mean that moment of inertia is a vector quantity.
				Note that a shape can have multiple centroidal moments of inertia, because more than one axis can pass through the centroid of a shape.
				In this text, we will only the vertical and horizontal axes, but they are not the only possibilities.
			</p>
      <p>
				The centroidal moment of inertia is particularly important.
				We will see in <xref ref="parallel-axis-theorem"/> that if we know a shape's centroidal moment of inertia for some axis direction, it is a simple process to calculate the moment of inertia of the shape about any other parallel axis.
				The moment of inertia is used in Mechanics of Materials to find stress and deflection in beams and to determine the load which will cause a column to buckle.
			</p>
      <p>
				We stated earlier that the centroidal moment of inertia is the minimum moment of inertia, but by this we mean, the minimum moment of inertia for a particular axis direction, for example horizontal.
				Other centroidal axes may have a different moment of inertia, either larger or smaller than the moment of inertia about a horizontal centroidal axis.
				The centroidal axes which have the absolute minimum and maximum moment of inertia are called the principle axes.
				The principle axes are not necessarily horizontal and vertical.

        <title>Beam bending</title>
        <p>
					To get a feel for how moment of inertia affects engineering design, find a ruler, a yardstick, or something similar: long with a rectangular cross section.
				</p>
        <p>
					Try to bend the ruler both when it's flat and also when it's turned on edge.
					You will find that bending the ruler around the <m>x</m> axis while it's flat is easy compared to bending it the other way, around the <m>z</m> axis.
					Why is it easier to bend the ruler one way than the other? It's the same object, made of the same material either way.
				</p>
        <p>
					The answer has to due with the moment of inertia, and how it relates to the bending axis.

					As engineers we are not satisfied with merely knowing that it's harder to bend a ruler one way than the other, we'd like to know <em>how much harder</em>?
				</p>
        <p>
					For a <m>\inch{1/8}</m> thick ruler that is <m>\inch{1}</m> tall, the bending resistance about the <m>z</m> axis is over 20 times more than the bending resistance the other way, about the <m>x</m> axis.
				</p>
        <p>
					To further see how the moment of inertia comes into play, consider the curvature caused by applying opposing moments to the ends of a beam such as your ruler.
					You will cause it to bend into an arc of a circle of some radius.
					A curious engineer would like to know how the curvature of the beam is related to the applied moment, the geometry, and the physical properties of the beam.

				The polar moment of inertia is a another measure of the distribution of an area but, in this case, about a point at the origin rather than about an axis.
				One important application of this value is to quantify the resistance of a shaft to torsion or twisting due to the shape of its cross-section.
			</p>
      <insight>
        <title>Why don't we call the polar moment of inertia <m>I_z</m>?</title>
        <p>
					The squared distance in the polar moment of inertia formula is the distance from the <m>z</m> axis, so it would seem reasonable to name the polar moment <m>I_z</m> to be consistent with <m>I_x</m> and <m>I_y,</m> which use distances from the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes.

				</p>
        <p>
					As shown in the interactive, the rectangular moment of inertia <m>I</m> involves rotating element <m>dA</m> about out-of-plane around an in-plain axis, and the polar moment <m>J</m> involves rotating the element in-plane around a perpendicular axis.

    <title>Moments of Inertia of Common Shapes</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
				In following sections we will use the integral definitions of moment of inertia <xref ref="MOI"/> to find the moments of inertia of five common shapes: rectangle, triangle, circle, semi-circle, and quarter-circle with respect to a specified axis.
				The integration techniques demonstrated can be used to find the moment of inertia of any two-dimensional shape about any desired axis.
			</p>
      <p>
				Moments of inertia depend on both the shape, and the axis.
				Pay attention to the placement of the axis with respect to the shape, because if the axis is located elsewhere or oriented differently, the results will be different.
			</p>
      <p>
				We will begin with the simplest case: the moment of inertia of a rectangle about a horizontal axis located at its base.
				This case arises frequently and is especially simple because the boundaries of the shape are all constants.

      <title>Moment of Inertia of a Rectangle</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
					Consider the <m>(b \times h)</m> rectangle shown.
					This rectangle is oriented with its bottom-left corner at the origin and its upper-right corner at the point <m>(b,h)</m>, where <m>b</m> and <m>h</m> are constants.
				</p>
        <p>
					What is the moment of inertia of this rectangle with respect to the <m>x</m> axis?
				</p>
        <p>
					To find the moment of inertia, divide the area into square differential elements <m>dA</m> at <m>(x,y)</m> where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can range over the entire rectangle and then evaluate the integral using double integration.
				</p>
        <p>
					The differential element <m>dA</m> has width <m>dx</m> and height <m>dy</m>, so
					<men>
						dA = dx\ dy = dy\ dx
					</men>.

        <p>
					It would seem like this is an insignificant difference, but the order of <m>dx</m> and <m>dy</m> in this expression determines the order of integration of the double integral.

          If you are not familiar with double integration, briefly you can think of a double integral as two normal single integrals, one <sq>inside</sq> and the other <sq>outside,</sq> which are evaluated one at a time from the inside out.

          <title>Stresses in a Rectangular Beam</title>
          <p>
						To provide some context for area moments of inertia, let's examine the internal forces in a elastic beam.
						Assume that some external load is causing an external bending moment which is opposed by the internal forces exposed at a cut.
					</p>
          <p>
						When an elastic beam is loaded from above, it will sag.
						Fibers on the top surface will compress and fibers on the bottom surface will stretch, while somewhere in between the fibers will neither stretch or compress.
						The points where the fibers are not deformed defines a transverse axis, called the <term>neutral axis</term>.
						The neutral axis passes through the centroid of the beam's cross section.
					</p>
          <p>
						The change in length of the fibers are caused by internal compression and tension forces which increase linearly with distance from the neutral axis.
						The internal forces sum to zero in the horizontal direction, but they produce a net couple-moment which resists the external bending moment.

						Think about summing the internal moments about the neutral axis on the beam cut face.
						This moment at a point on the face increases with the square of the distance <m>y</m> of the point from the neutral axis because both the internal force and the moment arm are proportional to this distance.
						The appearance of <m>y^2</m> in this relationship is what connects a bending beam to the area moment of inertia.
					</p>
          <p>
						The shape of the beam's cross-section determines how easily the beam bends.
						A beam with more material farther from the neutral axis will have a larger moment of inertia and be stiffer.
						Of course, the material of which the beam is made is also a factor, but it is independent of this geometrical factor.

				We saw in the last section that when solving <xref ref="MOI"/> the double integration could be conducted in either order, and that the result of completing the inside integral was a single integral.
				We will use these observations to optimize the process of finding moments of inertia for other shapes by avoiding double integration.
			</p>
      <p>
        The most straightforward approach is to use the definitions of the moment of inertia <xref ref="MOI"/> along with strips <em>parallel</em> to the designated axis,
        <ie/>
        horizontal strips when you want to find the moment of inertia about the <m>x</m> axis and vertical strips for the moment of inertia about the <m>y</m> axis.
			
      
      
      
      
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>
				The strip must be parallel in order for <xref ref="MOI"/> to work; when parallel, all parts of the strip are the same distance from the axis.
			</p>
      </aside>
      <p>
				This approach only works if the bounding function can be described as a function of <m>y</m> and as a function of <m>x</m>, to enable integration with respect to <m>x</m> for the vertical strip, and with respect to <m>y</m> for the horizontal strip.

          <p>
						As we did when finding centroids in <xref ref="centroids-by-integration"/> we need to evaluate the bounding function of the triangle.
						The bottom are constant values, <m>y=0</m> and <m>x=b</m>, but the top boundary is a straight line passing through the origin and the point at <m>(b,h)</m>, which has the equation
						<men xml:id="straight-line"> y(x) = \frac{h}{b} x

						By inspection we see that the a vertical strip extends from the <m>x</m> axis to the function so <m>dA= y\ dx</m>.
					</p>

            Since vertical strips are parallel to the <m>y</m> axis we can find <m>I_y</m> by evaluating this integral with <m>dA = y\ dx</m>, and substituting <m>\frac{h}{b} x</m> for <m>y</m>

				In this section, we will use polar coordinates and symmetry to find the moments of inertia of circles, semi-circles and quarter-circles.
			</p>
      <p>
				We will start by finding the polar moment of inertia of a circle with radius <m>r</m>, centered at the origin.
				You will recall from <xref ref="polar-moi"/> that the polar moment of inertia is similar to the ordinary moment of inertia, except the distance squared term is the distance from the element to a point in the plane rather than the perpendicular distance to an axis, and it uses the symbol <m>J</m> with a subscript indicating the point.
			</p>
      <p>
				To take advantage of the geometry of a circle, we'll divide the area into thin rings, as shown in the diagram, and define the distance from the origin to a point on the ring as <m>\rho</m>.
				The reason for using thin rings for <m>dA</m> is the same reason we used strips parallel to the axis of interest to find <m>I_x</m> and <m>I_y</m>; all points on the differential ring are the same distance from the origin, so we can find the moment of inertia using single integration.

      <title>Summary of Integration Techniques</title>
      <p>
				Here is a summary of the alternate approaches to finding the moment of inertia of a shape using integration.
			</p>
      <p>
				You may choose to divide the shape into square differential elements to compute the moment of inertia, using the fundamental definitions, The disadvantage of this approach is that you need to set up and compute a double integral.
				Identifying the correct limits on the integrals is often difficult.
			</p>
      <p>
				If you would like to avoid double integration, you may use vertical or horizontal strips, but you must take care to apply the correct integral.
				If you use vertical strips to find <m>I_y</m> or horizontal strips to find <m>I_x</m>, then you can still use <xref ref="MOI"/>, but skip the double integration.
				When the entire strip is the same distance from the designated axis, integrating with a parallel strip is equivalent to performing the inside integration of <xref ref="MOI"/>.
			</p>
      <p>
				As we have seen, it can be difficult to solve the bounding functions properly in terms of <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> to use parallel strips.
				In this case, you can use vertical strips to find <m>I_x</m> or horizontal strips to find <m>I_y</m> as discussed by integrating the differential moment of inertia of the strip, as discussed in <xref ref="MOI-differential-strips"/>.

    <title>Parallel Axis Theorem</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
				The parallel axis theorem relates the moment of inertia of a shape about an arbitrary axis to its moment of inertia about a parallel centroidal axis.
			</p>
      <p>
				This theorem is particularly useful because if we know the centroidal moment of inertia of a shape, we can calculate its moment of inertia about any parallel axis by adding an appropriate correction factor.
				Alternately, if we know the moment of inertia about an axis, we can find the associated centroidal moment of inertia by subtracting the same factor.
			</p>
      <p>
				The centroidal moment of inertia of common shapes are well known, and readily available in tables of properties of shapes such as <xref ref="MOI-table"/>.

        The first is the value we are looking for, and the second is the centroidal moment of inertia of the shape.

      <p>
				You should recognize these three integrals.
				The first is the centroidal moment of inertia of the shape <m>\bar{I}_{x'}</m>, and the third is the total area of the shape, <m>A</m>.
				The middle integral is <m>Q_{x'}</m>, the <xref ref="first-moment">first moment of area</xref> with respect to the centroidal axis <m>x'</m>.
				So we have,
				<me>
					I_x = \bar{I}_{x'} + 2 d Q_{x'} + d^2 A
				</me>.
			</p>
      <p>
				Furthermore, <m>Q_{x'}</m> is exactly zero because the <m>x'</m> axis passes through the centroid, meaning that elements of area above and below the centroidal axis exactly balance and cancel each other out.
				After dropping the middle term we get the version of the parallel axis theorem which you should remember,
				<men xml:id="parallel-axis-theorem"> I = \bar{I} + A d^2
				</men>.
			</p>
      <p>
				The subscripts designating the <m>x</m> and <m>x'</m> axes have been dropped because this equation is applicable to any direction of parallel axes, not specifically horizontal axes.
			</p>
      <p>
				This equation says that you find the moment of inertia of a shape about <em>any</em> axis by adding <m>Ad^2</m> to the <em>parallel</em> centroidal moment of inertia.
				You can consider the <m>Ad^2</m> term as <sq>correction factor</sq> to account for the distance of the axis from the centroid.
				This term is always positive, so the centroidal moment of inertia is always the minimum moment of inertia for a particular axis direction.
			</p>
      <p>
				The next example show how the parallel axis theorem is typically used to find the moment of inertia of a shape about an axis, by using then centroidal moment of inertia formulas found in <xref ref="MOI-table"/>.

				In this section we will find the moment of inertia of shapes formed by combining simple shapes like rectangles, triangles and circles much the same way we did to find centroids in <xref ref="composite-parts"/>.
			</p>
      <p>
				The procedure is to divide the complex shape into its sub shapes and then use the centroidal moment of inertia formulas from <xref ref="MOI-table"/>, along with the parallel axis theorem <xref ref="parallel-axis-theorem"/> to calculate the moments of inertia of parts, and finally combine them to find the moment of inertia of the original shape.

    <subsection xml:id="Chapter_10-composite-area-method">
      <title>Composite Area Method</title>
      <p>
				For a composite shape made up of <m>n</m> subparts, the moment of inertia of the whole shape is the sum of the moments of inertia of the individual parts, however the moment of inertia of any holes are subtracted from the total of the positive areas.
			</p>
      <p>
        Moments of inertia are always calculated relative to a specific axis, so the moments of inertia of all the sub shapes must be calculated with respect to this same axis, which will usually involve applying the parallel axis theorem.

      <title>Structural Steel Sections</title>
      <p>
		Steel is a strong, versatile, and durable material commonly used for girders, beams, and columns in steel structures such as buildings, bridges, and ships.
		When possible designers prefer to use prefabricated <em>Standardized Structural Steel</em> to minimize material cost.
	</p>
      <p>
		Structural steel is available in a variety of shapes called <em>sections</em>, shown below.
		These include universal beams and columns (W, S), structural channels (C), equal and unequal angle sections (L), Tee shapes (T), rectangular, square and round hollow structural sections (HSS), bar, rod, and plate.
		All are available in a range of sizes from small to huge.
		Steel sections are manufactured by hot or cold rolling or fabricated by welding flat or curved steel plates together.

      <p>
		Designers and engineers must select the most appropriate and economical section which can support the potential tension, compression, shear, torsion and bending loads.
		Tables of properties of Standard Steel Sections are published by the American Institute of Steel Construction, and are used to simplify the process.
		The tables contain important properties of the sections, including dimensions, cross sectional area, weight per foot, and moment of inertia about vertical and horizontal axes.
		An abbreviated subset of the AISC tables are available in <xref ref="AISC-properties"/>.
	</p>
      <p>
		In this section we will use the information in the AISC tables to find the moments of inertia of standard sections and also of composite shapes incorporating standard sections.

        <p>
			The top and bottom pieces of an I-beam are called flanges.
			The middle portion is referred to as the web.
			The flanges take most of the internal compression and tension forces as they are located the furthest from the neutral axis, and the web mainly acts to support any shear forces and hold the two flanges apart.
			The transverse axis through the centroid of the cross section is called the neutral axis, and cutting plane through the beam at the neutral axis is called the neutral plane, or neutral surface.
			This surface does not lengthen or shorten during bending.

      <title>Torsional Stress</title>
      <p>
			The polar moment of inertia is an important factor in the design of drive shafts.
			When a shaft is subjected to torsion, it experiences internal distributed shearing forces throughout its cross-section which counteract the external torsional load.
		</p>
      <p>
			This distributed shearing force is called <term>shear stress</term>, and is usually given the symbol tau, <m>\tau</m>.
			Shear stress is zero at the shaft centerline, called the <term>neutral axis</term>, and increases linearly with <m>r</m> to a maximum value, <m>\tau_\text{max}</m> at the outside surface where <m>r=c</m>, so

    <p>
		The radius of gyration is an alternate way of expressing the distribution of area away from an axis which combines the effects of the moments of inertia and cross sectional area.
	</p>
    <p>
		The radius of gyration can be thought of as the radial distance to a thin strip which has the same area and the same moment of inertia around a specific axis as the original shape.
		Compared to the moment of inertia, the radius of gyration is easier to visualize since it's a distance, rather than a distance to the fourth power.

		Unlike the rectangular moments of inertia, which are always positive, the product of inertia may be either positive, negative, or zero, depending on the object's shape and the orientation of the coordinate axes.
		The product of inertia will be zero for symmetrical objects when a coordinate axis is also an axis of symmetry.
	</p>
    <p>
		If the product of inertia is not zero it is always possible to rotate the coordinate system until it is, in which case the new coordinate axes are called the <term>principle axes</term>.
		When the coordinate axes are oriented in the principle directions, the centroidal moments of inertia are maximum about one axis and minimum about the other, but neither is necessarily zero.
		The principle directions determine the best way to orient a beam to for maximum stiffness, and how much asymmetrical beams, like channels and angles, will twist when a load is applied.

    <title>Mass Moment of Inertia</title>
    <p>
		You may recall from physics the relationship
		<me>
			T = I \alpha
		</me>.
		This formula is the rotational analog of Newton's second law <m>F = ma</m>.
		Here, the <m>I</m> represents the <term>mass moment of inertia,</term> which is the three-dimensional measure of a rigid body's resistance to rotation around an axis.
		Mass moment of inertia plays the same role for angular motion as <em>mass</em> does for linear motion.
	</p>
    <p>
		Mass moment of inertia is defined by an integral equation identical to <xref ref="MOI"/>, except that the differential area <m>dA</m> is replaced with a differential element of mass, <m>dm</m>.
		The integration is conducted over a three dimensional physical object instead of a two dimensional massless area.
	</p>
    <p>
		The units of mass moment of inertia are <m>[\mathrm{mass}][\mathrm{length}]^2</m>, in contrast to area moment of inertia's units of <m>[\mathrm{length}]^4</m>.
	</p>
    <p>
		Mass moments of inertia are covered in more detail and used extensively in the study of rigid body kinetics in <em>Engineering Dynamics</em>.
