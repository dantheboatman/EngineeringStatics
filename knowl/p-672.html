<div class="para">As we did before, we begin our analysis by drawing a free-body diagram that shows all forces and moments acting on the object of interest. Drawing a <abbr class="acronym">FBD</abbr> in three dimensions can be difficult. It is sometimes hard to see things in three dimensions when they are drawn on a two-dimensional sheet. Consequently, it is important to carefully label vectors and angles, but not to clutter up the diagram with too much and/or unnecessary information. When working in two dimensions, you only need one angle to determine the direction of the vector, but when working in three dimensions you need two or three angles.</div>
