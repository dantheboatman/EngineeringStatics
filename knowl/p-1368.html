<div class="para">If the shape has an axis of symmetry, every point on one side of the axis is mirrored by another point equidistant on the other side. One has a positive distance from the axis, and the other is the same distance away in the negative direction. These two points will add to zero the numerator, as will every other point making up the shape, and the first moment will be zero. This means that the centroid must lie along the line of symmetry if there is one. If a shape has multiple symmetry lines, then the centroid must exist at their intersection.</div>
