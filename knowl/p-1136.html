<div class="para">For example, look at the members and joints in the truss below. Diagram (a) shows the truss members held together by pins at <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> The forces holding the parts together cancel and are not shown. In the ‘exploded’ view (b), the parts have been separated and the action-reaction pairs are exposed. Member <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> is in tension, and the forces acting on it, also called <span class="process-math">\(AB\text{,}\)</span> oppose each other and tend to stretch the member. These stretching forces are accompanied by equal and opposite forces, also called <span class="process-math">\(AB\)</span> acting on pins <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Tensile forces <span class="process-math">\(BC\)</span> and compressive forces <span class="process-math">\(CA\)</span> behave similarly.</div>
