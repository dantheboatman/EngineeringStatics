<p><dfn class="terminology">Assumptions</dfn></p>
<p>We must assume that the block is in equilibrium, that is, either motionless or moving at a constant velocity in order to use the equilibrium equations.  We will represent the block's weight and the force between the incline and the block as concentrated forces.  The force of the inclined surface on the block must act in a direction which is normal to the surface since it is frictionless and can't prevent motion along the surface.</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Givens</dfn></p>
<p>The knowns here are the weight of the block, the direction of the applied force, and the slope of the incline.  The slope of the incline provides the direction of the normal force.</p>
<p>The unknown values are the magnitudes of forces \(P\) and \(N\text{.}\)</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Free Body Diagram</dfn></p>
<p>You should always begin a statics problem by drawing a free body diagram.  It gives you an opportunity to think about the situation, identify knowns and unknowns, and define symbols.</p>
<p>We define three symbols, \(W\text{,}\) \(N\text{,}\) and \(P\text{,}\) representing the weight, normal force, and the applied force respectively.  The angles could be given symbols too, but since we know their values it isn't necessary.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:2.5%;margin-right:2.5%;">
<div class="sbspanel" style="width:42.1052631578947%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/image-13.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div>

<p>The free body can be a quick sketch or an accurate drawing but it must show <em class="emphasis">all</em> the forces acting on the particle and define the symbols.  In most cases you won't know the magnitudes of all the forces, so the lengths of the vectors are just approximate.</p>
<p>Notice that the force \(N\) is represented as acting 25° from the \(y\)-axis, which is 90° away from the direction of the surface.</p>
</div>
</div></div>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Force Triangle</dfn></p>
<p>Use the known information to carefully and accurately construct the force triangle.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:2.5%;margin-right:2.5%;">
<div class="sbspanel" style="width:52.6315789473684%;justify-content:flex-start;"><ol class="decimal">
<li>Start by placing point \(A\) at the origin.</li>
<li>Draw force \(\vec{W}\) straight down from \(A\) with a length of 1, and place point \(B\) at its tip.  The length of this vector represents the weight.</li>
<li>We know the direction of force \(\vec{P}\) but not its magnitude.  For now, just draw line \(BC\) passing through point \(B\) with an angle of 10° from the \(x\)-axis.</li>
<li>Similarly we know force \(\vec{N}\) acts perpendicular to the inclined surface, and will close the triangle. So draw line \(CA\) passing through point \(A\) and at a 25° angle from the \(y\)-axis.</li>
<li>Call the point where lines \(BC\) and \(CA\) intersect point \(C\text{.}\)  Points \(A\text{,}\) \(B\text{,}\) and \(C\) define the force triangle.</li>
<li>Now you can draw force \(\vec{P}\) from point \(B\) to point \(C\text{,}\) and</li>
<li>Draw force \(\vec{N}\) from point \(C\) back to point \(A\text{.}\)</li>

<p>You follow along with the instructions on the diagram below by clicking the <span class="fas fa-fast-backward"></span> arrow to go to the start, then click the <span class="fas fa-forward"></span> arrow to step through the process.</p>
<p>Can you prove from the geometry of the triangle that angle BCA is 75°?</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Results</dfn></p>
<p>In steps 6 and 7, Geogebra tells us that  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">p = (0.438;10.0°)</code> which means force \(P\)  is 0.438 units long with a direction of 10°, similarly  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">n = (1.02;115°)</code> means \(N\) is 1.02 units long at 115°. These angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive \(x\)-axis.</p>
<p>These are not the answers we are looking for, but we're close.  Remember that for this diagram, our scale is</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
1 \text{ unit} = 100 \text{ lbs}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p data-braille="continuation">so scaling the lengths of  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">p</code> and  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">n</code> by this factor gives</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
P \amp = 0.438 \text{ units} \cdot  ({100\text{ lb} / \text{unit}})  \\
\amp = 43.8 \text{ lb at 10°} \measuredangle\\
N \amp= 1.02 \text{ units} \cdot   ({100\text{ lb} / \text{unit}})  \\
\amp = 102 \text{ lb at 115°} \measuredangle
\end{align*}
