<div class="para">The effect of the floor on the block is represented by a single vertical force <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> which holds the block the same way the floor was previously supporting it; the loads you add must constrain your object the same way they were constrained in the real world. This representation is really a simplification of the actual situation since the force of the floor is really distributed over the bottom surface of the block; however, this simplification is justified in much the same way as we represent the weight of an object as a single force acting at its center of gravity.</div>
