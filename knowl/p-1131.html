<div class="para">Many structures contain at least one two-force member, and trusses consist of two-force members exclusively. Recall from <a href="CH03-1d-particles.html#two-force-bodies" class="internal" title="Subsection 3.3.3: Two-force Bodies">SubsectionÂ 3.3.3</a> that a two-force body is an object subjected to exactly two forces. Two-force members are not required to be slender or straight, but can be recognized because they connect to other bodies or supports at exactly two points, and have no other loading unless it is also applied at those points.</div>
