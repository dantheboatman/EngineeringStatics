<div class="para">A bearing is a machine element used to support a rotating shaft. Bearing friction exists between the rotating shaft and the supporting bearing. Though other types of bearings exist including, ball, roller and hydrodynamic, we will focus on <em class="emphasis">dry friction</em> journal bearings. Oil lubricated journal bearings require a knowledge of fluid mechanics to analyze, while dry journal bearings have point contact between the shaft and bearing and thus can be analyzed in Statics, they are subject to greater wear and heat build-up than other types of bearings; thus, the use of dry journal bearings is only advisable in situations where there is limited motion.</div>
