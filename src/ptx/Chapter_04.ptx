  <title>Moments and Static Equivalence</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>When a force is applied to a body, the body tends to translate in the direction of the force and also tends to rotate. We have already explored the translational tendency in <xref ref="Chapter_03"/>. We will focus on the rotational tendency in this chapter. </p>
    <p>This rotational tendency is known as the moment of the force, or more simply the <term>moment</term>. You may be familiar with the term <alert>torque</alert> from physics. Engineers use <q>torque</q> where physicists use <q>moment</q> to describe the same concept.   Moments are vectors, so they have magnitude and direction and obey all rules of vector addition and subtraction described in <xref ref="Chapter_02"/>.  Additionally, moments have a <em>center of rotation</em>, although it is more accurate to say that they have an axis of rotation. In two dimensions, the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the page and so will appear as a <term>point of rotation</term>, also called the <term>moment center</term>. In three dimensions, the axis of rotation can be any direction in 3D space.</p>

      <p>A wrench provides a familiar example. A force <m>\vec{F}</m> applied to the handle of a wrench, as shown in <xref ref="ggb_dxxgfxru"/>, creates a  moment <m>\vec{M}_A</m> about an axis out of the page through the centerline of the nut at <m>A</m>.  The <m>\vec{M}</m> is bold because it represents a vector, and the subscript <m>A</m> indicates the axis or center of rotation.  The direction of the moment can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on how the force is applied.</p>

    <title>Direction of a Moment</title>
    <p>In a two-dimensional problem the direction of a moment can be determined easily by inspection as either clockwise or counter-clockwise. A counter-clockwise rotation corresponds with a moment vector pointing out of page and is considered positive.   </p>
    <p>In three-dimensions a moment vector may point in any direction in space and is more difficult to visualize. The direction is established by the <em>right hand rule</em>. </p>
    <p>To apply the right hand rule, first establish a a <term>position vector</term>
         <m>\vec{r}</m> pointing <em>from</em> the rotation center <em>to</em> the point of application of the force, or another point on its line of action.  If you align your thumb with the position vector and your index finger with the force vector, then your middle finger points the direction of the moment vector <m>\vec{M}</m>. Alternately, you can align your index finger with the position vector and your middle finger with the force vector, and your thumb will point in the direction of the moment vector.</p>
    <p/>

		<description>Using the right hand, point index finger straiht out, the thumb up (like giving a thumbs-up), and the middle finger pointed perpindicular to the pointer finger and thumb. The thumb represents the position vector, and the index finger represnets the force vector. Taking the cross product r x F results in M which is representeed by the middle finger. Alternatively, r can be the index finger, F the middle finger, and M the thumb.</description>

    </figure>
    <p>Another approach is the point-and-curl method. Start with your hand flat and fingertips pointing along the position vector <m>\vec{r}</m> pointing <em>from</em> the center of rotation <em>to</em> a point on the force’s line of action. Adjust your hand so the force vector <m>\vec{F}</m> pushes fingers into a curl. Your thumb then defines the direction of the moment <m>\vec{M}</m>. </p>

    <p>Any of these techniques may be used to find the direction of a moment. They all produce the same result so you don’t need to learn them all, but make sure you have at least one method you can use accurately and consistently.</p>

        <li>Why is there no moment about any point on the line of action of a force?</li>

    <introduction>
      <p>Moments in two dimensions can only cause a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation in the plane of the page. This means that we can completely describe a two-dimensional moment with a signed scalar value.  This signed value is called the <term>scalar moment</term>.  The numerical value indicates its magnitude and the sign indicates its direction. By convention, a positive sign indicates a counter-clockwise moment and a negative sign means clockwise.  This sign convention is chosen to be consistent with the right hand rule.  </p>
      <p>As you probably know, the strength of the moment (or torque) produced by a wrench depends on where and how much force you apply to the wrench. If the nut won't budge, you can apply a larger force or get a longer wrench, and the optimum direction to apply the force is at at right angles to the wrench’s handle. </p>

          <p>The magnitude of a scalar moment can be found by multiplying the magnitude of force <m>\vec{F}</m> times the <term>moment arm</term>, where the moment arm is defined as the <term>perpendicular distance,</term>
                  <m>d_{\perp}</m>, from the center of rotation to the line of action of the force, measured perpendicularly as illustrated in the interactive. <men xml:id="moment-definition">M =F d_{\perp}</men>.

    <title>Varignon’s Theorem</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>Varignon’s Theorem is a method to calculate moments developed in 1687 by French mathematician Pierre Varignon (1654 <ndash/> 1722). It states that sum of the moments of several concurrent forces about a point is equal to the moment of the resultant of those forces, or alternately, the moment of a force about a point equals the sum of the moments of its components.</p>
      <p>This means you can find the moment of a force by first breaking it into components, evaluating the scalar moments of the individual components, and finally summing them to find the net moment about the point.  The scalar moment of a component is the magnitude of the component times the perpendicular distance to the moment center by the <xref ref="moment-definition" text="custom"> definition of a moment</xref>, with a positive or negative sign assigned to indicate its direction.</p>
      <sidebyside widths="48% 50%" margins="0%">
        <p>This may sound like more work than just finding the moment of the original force, but in practice it is often easier.  Consider the interactive to the right.  If we break the force into components along the wrench handle and perpendicular to it, the sum of the moments of these component is <men xml:id="moment-fperp"> M = F_\perp d </men>, where <m>d</m> is the length of the handle, and <m>F_\perp</m> is the component of <m>F</m> perpendicular to the handle.  Here, the contribution of the parallel component to the sum is zero, since its line of action passes through the moment center <m>A</m>. </p>
        <figure>
          <caption>Verignon's Theorem: <m> M = F_\perp d</m>

          <xi:include href="interactives.ptx" xpointer="ggb_dan-wrench-3_interactive"/>
        </figure>
      </sidebyside>
      <p>This result agrees with our intuitive understanding of how a wrench works; the greatest torque is developed when the force is applied at a right angle to the handle.</p>
      <p>Equations <xref ref="moment-definition"/> and <xref ref="moment-fperp"/> not only produce the same result, they are completely identical.  If the length of the handle is <m>d</m> and the angle between the force <m>\vec{F}</m> and the handle is <m>\theta</m>, then <m>d_\perp = d \sin \theta</m> and <m>F_\perp = F \sin \theta</m>.  Using either equation to calculate the moment gives <men xml:id="moment-general">M = F\ d\ \sin \theta</men>.</p>

          <p>Assigning a negative sign to <m>M_1</m> and a positive sign to <m>M_2</m> to account for their directions and summing, gives the moment of <m>\vec{F}</m> about <m>A</m>.

      <p>Moments are vectors and they will typically have components in the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> directions in three-dimensional situations.  The circular arrows we used to represent vectors in two dimensions are unclear in three dimensions, so moments are drawn as vectors just like force and position vectors, although you will sometimes see moments drawn with double arrowheads to differentiate them from force vectors. In three-dimensions, it is usually not convenient to find the moment arm and use equation <xref ref="moment-definition"/>, so instead we will use the vector cross product, which is easier to apply but less intuitive.</p>

      <p>Alternately, if you know or can find the components of the position <m>\vec{r}</m> and force <m>\vec{F}</m> vectors, it's typically easiest to evaluate the moment cross product using the determinant form discussed in <xref ref="vector-cross-products"/>.

      <title>Moment about a Line</title>
      <p>In three dimensions, the moment of a force about a point can be resolved into components about the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axes.  The moment produces a rotational tendency about all three axes simultaneously, but only a portion of the total moment acts about any particular axis. </p>
      <p>We are often interested in finding the effect of a moment about a specific line or axis. For example, consider the moment created by a push on a door handle. Unless you push with a force exactly perpendicular to the hinge, only a portion of the total moment you produce will act around the hinge axis and be effective to open the door.  The moment we are looking for is the vector projection of the moment onto the axis of interest.  Vector projections were first discussed in <xref ref="vector-projections"/>.</p>

        <li>What makes a couple different than a typical <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moment? </li>
        <li>Why is a couple considered a pure moment?</li>
        <li>If a couple is applied about the point we are summing moments, does it still need to be included in the sum of moments equation?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>The moments we have considered so far were all caused single forces producing rotation about a moment center. In this section we will consider another type of moment, called a <term>couple</term>.  </p>
    <p> A couple consists of two parallel forces, equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and non-coincident. Couples are special because the pair of forces always cancel each other, which means that a couple produces a rotational effect but never translation.  For this reason, couples are sometimes referred to as <q>pure moments.</q> The strength of the rotational effect is called the <term>moment of the couple</term> or the <term>couple-moment</term>. </p>
    <p>When a single force causes a moment about a point, the magnitude depends on the magnitude of the force and the location of the point. In contrast, the moment of a couple is the same at every point and only depends on magnitude of the opposite forces and the distance between them.  </p>
    <sidebyside widths="48% 50%" margins="0%">
      <p>For example, consider the interactive where two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action form a couple.   The moment of this couple is found by summing the moments of the two forces about arbitrary moment center <m>A,</m> applying positive or negative signs for each term according to the right hand rule.  The moment of the couple is always
<mdn><mrow number="yes"> M \amp= Fd_\perp </mrow></mdn> where <m>d_\perp</m> is the perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces.</p>

    <p/>
    <p>In two dimensions, couples are represented by a curved arrow indicating the direction of the rotational effect.  Following the right-hand rule the value will be positive if the moment is counter-clockwise and negative if it is clockwise.  In three dimensions, a couple is represented by a normal vector arrow.</p>
    <p>When adding moments to find the total or resultant moment,  you must include couple-moments as well the <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments. In equation form, we could express this as:
<me>\Sigma M_P = \Sigma (\vec{r}\times\vec{F} ) + \Sigma (\vec{M}_\text{couple}) </me>
      </p>
    <insight>
      <title>Location Independence</title>
      <p>In this section we have shown that couples produce the same moment at every point on the body.   This means that the external effect of couples is <em>location independent</em>.    Because the moment of a couple is location independent, the moment vector is not bound to any particular point and for this reason is a <em>free vector</em>.  </p>
      <p>We will learn in <xref ref="Chapter_08"/>  that moving a couple around on a rigid body does affect the <em>internal</em> loads or stresses inside a body, but changing the location of a couple does not change the <em>external</em> loading or reactions. </p>

        <li>What is an equivalent transformation?</li>
        <li>What are some examples of equivalent transformations?</li>
        <li>What are <em>external effects</em>?</li>
      </ul>
    </objectives>
    <p>An <em>equivalent transformation</em> occurs when a loading on an object is replaced with another loading which has the same <em>external</em> effect on the object.  By external effect we mean the response of the body that we can see from outside, with no consideration of what happens to it internally.  If the object is a free-body, the external effect would be translation and rotation.   In statics, since objects are not accelerating, the external effect really means the reactions at the supports required to maintain equilibrium.  The external effects will be exactly the same before and after an equivalent transformation.</p>
    <p>Equivalent transformation permits us to swap out one set of forces with another one without changing the fundamental physics of the situation.  This is usually done to simplify or clarify the situation, or to give you an alternate way to think about, understand, and solve a mechanics problem.</p>
    <p>You already know several equivalent transformations although we have not used this terminology before.  Here are some transformations you have applied previously.</p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Vector Addition</title>
      <p>When you add forces together using the rules of vector addition, you are performing an equivalent transformation. You can swap out two or more components and replace them with a single equivalent resultant force.  </p>
      <p>Any number of <em>concurrent</em> forces can be added together to produce a single resultant force. By definition, the lines of action of concurrent forces all intersect at a common point. The resultant must be placed at this intersection point in order for this replacement to be equivalent.  This is because before and after the replacement, the moment about the intersection point is zero.  If the resultant was placed somewhere else, that would not be true.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Replacing a Force with its Component</title>
      <p>Resolving forces into components is also an equivalent transformation, in fact this is just the inverse operation of vector addition. The components are usually orthogonal and in the coordinate directions, or in a given plane and perpendicular to it, but any combination of components forces that adds to the original force is equivalent.  </p>

		  <description>A fixed ring is shown with two forces F1 and F2. This is equal to a fixed ring with the resultant force shown acting at an angle of theta from the horizontal, which would be pointing towards the coordinates (F1x+F2x, F1y+F2y). This is equal to a fixed ring with a horizontal force of F*cos(theta) and vertical force of F*sin(theta).</description>

      <p>In this diagram, <me> \vec{F_1} + \vec{F}_2  = \vec{F} = (F; \theta) = \langle F \cos\theta, F\sin\theta \rangle</me>. The effects of the force in the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> and (in three dimensions the <m>z</m>) directions remains the same, and by Verignon’s theorem we know that the moment these forces make about any point will also be the same.</p>
      <p>An interesting special case occurs when two forces are equal and opposite and have the same line of action.  When these are added together, they cancel out, so replacing these two forces with nothing is an equivalent transformation.  The opposite is true as well, so you can make two equal and opposite forces spontaneously appear a point if you wish.</p>

    <insight>
      <title>Internal Effects</title>
      <p>We made a point of saying that equivalent systems of force have the same <m>external</m> effect on the body.  This implies that there may be some other effects which are not the same.  As you will see in <xref ref="Chapter_08"/>, we sometimes need to consider  internal forces and moments.  These are the forces inside a body which hold all the parts of the object to each other, otherwise it would break apart and fail.  Although the external effects are the same for all equivalent systems, the internal forces depend on the specifics of how the loads are applied.</p>

      <title>Sliding a force along its line of action</title>
      <p>Sliding a force along its line of action is an equivalent transformation because sliding a force does not change its magnitude, direction or the perpendicular distance from the line of action to any point, so the moments it creates do not change either.   This transformation is called the <q>Principle of Transmissibility</q>.</p>

      <title>Replacing a couple with couple-moment or vice-versa</title>
      <p>A <em>couple</em>, defined as <q>two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action,</q> produces a pure turning action that is equivalent to a concentrated moment, called the <em>couple-moment</em>.  Couples and couple-moments have no translational effect. Couple-moments are free vectors, which means that they are not bound to any point.  Their external effect is on the entire body and is the same regardless of where it is applied.</p>
      <p>This means that you are free to swap out a couple for its couple-moment, or swap a couple-moment for a couple which has the same moment, and you may put the replacement anywhere on you please and it will still be equivalent.</p>

      <p>Concentrated moments are <em>free vectors</em>, which you may draw the circular arrow anywhere you like on the body. In other words moving a concentrated moment from one point to another is an equivalent transformation.  Remember though, this equivalence only applies to the external effects.

            <m>\vec{M}_R</m>.  The standard rules of vector addition apply.</p>
      <p>In two-dimensional problems moments are either clockwise or counterclockwise, so they may be considered scalar values and added algebraically.  Give counterclockwise moments a positive sign and clockwise moments a negative sign according to the right hand rule sign convention.  If this is done, the sign of the resultant moment will indicate the direction of the net moment. You can use the right hand rule to establish the direction of the moment vector, which will point into or out of the page.</p>

    <p>A loading system is a combination of load forces and moments which act on an object.  It can be as simple as a single force, or as complex as a three-dimensional combination of many force and moment vectors.  </p>
    <p>You will see that any loading systems may be replaced with a simpler <em>statically equivalent system</em> consisting of one <em>resultant force</em> at a specific point and one <em>resultant moment</em> by performing a series of equivalent transformations.  Force system resultants provide a convenient representation for complex force interactions at engineering connections that we will rely on later in a variety of contexts. For now we will focus on the details of reducing a system to a single force and couple.</p>
    <p>Depending on the original loading system, the resultant force, the resultant moment, or both may be zero.  If they are both zero, it indicates that the object is in equilibrium under this load condition.  If they are non-zero, the supports will need to provide an equal and opposite reaction to put the object into equilibrium.</p>
    <p>The resultant force acting on a system, <m>\vec{R}</m>, can be found from adding the individual forces, <m>\vec{F}_i</m>, such that <me>\vec{R}=\sum \vec{F} = \vec{F_1}+\vec{F_2}+\vec{F_3}+...</me>.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>The resultant moment, <m>\vec{M}_O</m>, about a point <m>O</m>, can be found from adding all of the moments <m>\vec{M}</m>, about that point, including both <m>\vec{r}\times\vec{F}</m> moments and concentrated moments.  </p>

      <p>One transformation you might <em>want</em> to make is to move a force to another location.  While <em>sliding</em> a force along its line of action is fine, <em>moving</em> a force to another point changes its line of action and thus its rotational effect on the object, so moving is <em>not</em> an equivalent transformation.</p>
      <p>Consider the cantilever beam below.  In diagram (a), the load <m>P</m> is at the end of the beam, and in (b) it has been moved to the center.  The external effects are shown in (c) and (d).  Although the vertical reaction force is the <m>P</m> in both cases, the reaction moment at point <m>O</m> is is <m>2P\ell</m> in the first case and <m>P\ell</m> in the second.</p>

      <p>You <em>can</em> move a force to a new line of action in an equivalent fashion if you add a <q>compensatory couple</q> to undo the effect of changing the line of action.  This can be accomplished with of a series of individual equivalent transformations as shown in the diagram below.  To move P to another location, first add two equal and opposite forces where you want the force to be, as in (b).  Then recognize the couple you have formed (c), and replace it with an equivalent couple-moment. The result of this process is the <em>equivalent force-couple system</em> shown in diagram (d), which is statically equivalent to the original situation in (a).</p>

      <p>Evaluating the moment at point <m>O</m> at was an arbitrary choice.  Any other point would give the same result.  For example, in the original situation (a) force <m>P</m> makes a clockwise moment <m>M=P\ell</m> about the midpoint.  When the force is moved to the center <m>P</m> creates no moment there, so a clockwise compensatory couple with a magnitude of <m>P\ell</m> must be added to maintain equivalence. This is the same result as we found previously (d). The compensatory couple has been drawn centered around the midpoint, but this too is arbitrary because concentrated moments are free vectors and can be placed at any location.</p>

      </answer>
      <solution>
        <p>The original system is shown in (a). </p>
        <p>Since the <m>F_1</m> and <m>F_2</m> are parallel, the magnitude of the resultant force is just the sum of the two magnitudes and it points down. <me> R = F_1 + F_2</me>
            </p>

        <p>To create the equivalent system (b), the resultant force and resultant moment are placed at point <m>A</m>.</p>
        <p>The system in (b) can be further simplified to eliminate the moment at <m>M_A</m>, by performing the process in reverse.</p>
        <p>In (c) we place the resultant force <m>R</m> a  distance <m>d</m> away from point <m>A</m> such that the resultant moment around point <m>A</m> remains the same.  This distance can be found using <m>M = Fd</m>. <me>d = M_A/R</me>
            </p>
        <p>The systems in (a), (b), and (c) are all statically equivalent</p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>In this example, we started with two forces. We have found two different statically equivalent systems; one with a force and a couple, the other with a single force. This latter system is simpler than the original system.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that static equivalence applies to external effects only. When determining internal forces, such as the shear and bending moment discussed in <xref ref="VM_diagrams"/> or when considering non-rigid bodies, the original loading system must be used.</p>

    </example>
    <p>Any load system can be simplified to its resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m>, and resultant couple <m>\vec{M}</m>, acting at any arbitrary point <m>O</m>. There are four common special cases which are worth highlighting individually.</p>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Concurrent forces</title>
      <p>When all forces in a system are concurrent, the resultant moment about that their common intersection point will always be zero. We then need only find the resultant force and place it at the point of intersection. The resultant moment about any other point is the moment of the resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m> about that point.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Parallel forces</title>
      <p>When all forces in a system are parallel, the resultant force will act in this direction with a magnitude equal to the sum of the individual magnitudes. There will be no moment created about this axis, but we need to find the resultant moment about the other two rectangular axes. That is, if all forces act in the <m>x</m> direction, we need only find the resultant force in the <m>x</m> direction and the resultant moment about the <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axes.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Coplanar forces</title>
      <p>When all forces in a system are coplanar we need only find the resultant force in this plane and the resultant moment about the axis perpendicular to this plane. That is, if all forces exist in the <m>x</m>-<m>y</m> plane, we need only to sum components in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions to find resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m>, and use these to determine the resultant moment about the <m>z</m> axis. All two-dimensional problems fall into this category.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Wrench resultant</title>
      <p>A wrench resultant is a special case where the resultant moment acts around the axis of the resultant force. The directions of the resultant force vector and the resultant moment vector are the same.</p>

        <p>For example, if the resultant force is only in the <m>x</m> direction and the resultant moment acts only around the <m>x</m> axis, this is an example of a wrench resultant. An everyday example is a screwdriver, where both the resultant force and axis of rotation are in-line with the screwdriver. A wrench resultant is considered positive if the couple vector and force vector point in the same direction, and negative if they point in opposite directions.</p>
      </sidebyside>
      <p>Any three-dimensional force-couple system may be reduced to an equivalent wrench resultant even if the resultant force and resultant moment do not initially form a wrench resultant. </p>
      <p>To find the equivalent wrench resultant: 
<ol><li>First, find the resultant force <m>\vec{R}</m> and resultant moment <m>\vec{M}</m> at an arbitrary at arbitrary point, <m>O</m>. These need not act along the same axis.</li><li>Resolve the resultant moment into scalar components <m>M_\parallel</m> and <m>M_\perp</m>, parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the resultant force.</li><li>Eliminate <m>M_\perp</m> by moving the the resultant force away from point <m>O</m> by distance <m>d =  M_\perp/R</m>
               </li></ol>
         </p>
      <p>The simplified system consists of  moment <m>\vec{M}_\parallel</m> and  force <m>\vec{R}</m> and acting distance <m>d</m> away from point <m>O</m>. Since <m>\vec{R}</m> and  <m>\vec{M}_\parallel</m> act along the same axis, the system has been reduced to a wrench resultant. Wrench resultants are the most general way to represent a complex force-couple system, but their utility is limited.</p>
