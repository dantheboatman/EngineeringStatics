<p>Here's an example of a  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">svg</code> image with text rendered by latex overlaid. The composite image was saved as an  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">svg</code> file, then a copy was saved as a  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pdf</code> file without text, along with  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">balloon.pdf_tex</code> which was included in the source ptx as shown.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="images/image-116.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">E.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Image with overlaid text.</figcaption></figure><p>This image was composed of three parts,</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>The x-z plane and the three ropes were drawn in Geogebra, and a screenshot was used to capture the image as a png.  For 2D drawings Geogebra can export svg or png directly.</li>
<li>The balloon was a png image.</li>
<li>Both were imported into a svg image in Inkscape, where the axis labels, point labels, and the height were added with the text tool. The dotted line, and the dimension arrows were drawn in using Inkscape's tools.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you look in the ptx/resources/ch03/balloon directory you will find all the intermediate files I used They are:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li>
<em class="emphasis">chap_2_P8.png</em> Jacob's original diagram</li>
<li>
<em class="emphasis">balloononly.png</em> The Balloon image without the lines or the dimensions, which I pulled and cleaned up from the original with photoshop.</li>
<li>
<em class="emphasis">background.ggb</em> A Geogebra file which I made to draw the ground plane and the cables.</li>
<li>
<em class="emphasis">background.png</em> The exported images from geogebra. Unfortunately Geogebra won't export 3d diagrams as svg, so I used png.</li>
<li>
<em class="emphasis">balloon.svg</em>  A composite diagram I made in inkscape combining <em class="emphasis">ballooononly.png</em> and background.png and latex labels.</li>
<li>
<em class="emphasis">balloon.pdf</em> This file is the image without text, as exported from Inkscape.</li>
<li>
<em class="emphasis">balloon.pdf_tex</em> This file contains the instructions for the text and where to place it on top of balloon.pdf.</li>
</ul>
<p>When PreTeXt Generates the book it makes a pdf file which composites the text on top of the ballon and inserts it into the Latex version of the book, and it also uses <em class="emphasis">pdf2svg</em> to make an SVG version to use for the web version.</p>
