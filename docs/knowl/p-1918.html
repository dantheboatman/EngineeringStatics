<div class="para">Dry friction, also called <dfn class="terminology">Coulomb friction</dfn>, is a force which appears between two solid surfaces in contact. This force is distributed over the contact area and always acts in whichever direction opposes relative motion between the surfaces. We will usually simplify the distributed frictional force by representing it as a single concentrated force acting at a point, as we did in <a href="distributed-loads.html" class="internal" title="Section 7.8: Distributed Loads">SectionÂ 7.8</a>.</div>
