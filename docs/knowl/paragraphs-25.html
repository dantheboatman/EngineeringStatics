<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Three-dimensional Reactions.</span></h3> <div class="para">The main added complexity with three-dimensional objects is that there are more possible ways the object can move, and also more possible ways to restrain it. The table below show the types of supports which are available and the corresponding reaction forces and moment. As before, your free-body diagrams should show the reactions supplied by the constraints, not the constraints themselves.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/Reactions-3D.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="As in the previous table, support types are shown here. A support produces a reaction in the direction in which it prevents motion (1 reaction). Two-force support member constrains translation in one direction. Smooth surface constrains translation in one direction (1 reaction). Ball and socket constrains translation in 3 directions, but not rotation (3 reactions). Free axle bearing constrains translation in two directions (y and z) and rotation in two directions (couple moment about z and about y) (4 reactions). Confined axle bearings (e.g., thrust bearing, smooth pin, hinge) only allows rotation about one axis, and does not allow translation in any direction (5 reactions). A square axle bearing only allows translation in one direction, and no rotation (5 reactions). A fixed support prevents any translation or rotation (6 reactions)."></div>

Picture a crate sitting at rest on a horizontal surface with a cable attached to the top of the crate. If the cable is slack, the reaction of the cable would be available but not <em class="emphasis">engaged</em>. Instead, the floor would be supporting the full weight of the crate. If we were to remove the floor, the cable would be engaged and support the weight of the crate.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="external/images/cable-engaged.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="A box hangs from the ceiling by a cable. It rests on a flat surface. Therefore, the tension in the cable would be zero, and the T is not engaged. In the second image, the box hangs from a cable from the ceiling. It does not rest on a surface. Thus the tension T in the cable is nonzero, i.e. it is engaged."></div>

Can you feel your hand supplying an upward force to support the weight <em class="emphasis">and</em> a counter-clockwise reaction couple to keep it horizontal? Now add a similar support by gripping with your right hand. How do the forces and couple-moments change? You should have felt the force of your left hand decrease as your right hand picked up half the weight, and also noticed that the reaction couple from your left hand was no longer needed.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="external/images/one_vs_two_hands.jpg" class="contained" alt="Image of one hand holding an object versus two hands holding the same object, with corresponding free-body diagrams."></div>

The reaction couples from both hands are available, but the vertical forces engage first and are sufficient for equilibrium. This phenomena is described by the saying “reaction forces engage before reaction couple-moments”.</div> </section><span class="incontext"><a href="Chapter_05-free-body-diagrams.html#paragraphs-25" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
