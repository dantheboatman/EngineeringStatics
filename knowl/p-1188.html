<div class="para">A solvable joint includes one or more known forces and no more than two unknown forces. If there are no joints that satisfy this condition then you will need to find the external reactions before proceeding, using a free-body diagram of the entire truss.</div>

<li><div class="para">Draw all known forces in their known directions with arrowheads indicating their sense. Known forces are the given loads, and forces determined from previously solved joints.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Assume the sense of unknown forces. A common practice is to assume that all unknown forces are in tension, i.e. pulling away from the free-body diagram of the pin, and label them based on the member they represent.</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="para">Finally, write out and solve the force equilibrium equations for the joint. If you assumed that all forces were tensile earlier, negative answers indicate compression.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">Once the unknown forces acting on a joint are determined, carry these values to the adjacent joints and repeat step four until all the joints have been solved. Take care when transferring forces to adjoining joints to maintain their sense — either tension or compression.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you solved for the reactions in step two, you will have more equations available than unknown forces when you reach the last joint. The extra equations can be used to check your work.</div></li>
