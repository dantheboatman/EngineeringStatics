<em class="emphasis">Select and isolate the particle.</em> The “free-body” in free-body diagram means that a concurrent force particle or connection must be isolated from the supports that are physically holding it in place. This means creating a separate free-body diagram from your problem sketch.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Establish a coordinate system.</em> Draw a right-handed coordinate system to use as a reference for your equilibrium equations. Look ahead and select a coordinate system that minimizes the number of force components. This will simplify your vector algebra. The choice is technically arbitrary, but a good choice will simplify your calculations and reduce your effort.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Identify all loads.</em> Add force vectors to your free-body diagram representing each applied load pushing or pulling the body, in addition to the body’s weight, if it is non-negligible. If a force vector has a known direction, draw it. If its direction is unknown, assume one, and your later algebra will check your assumption. Every vector should have a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead indicating its direction.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Identify all reactions.</em> Reactions represent the resistance of the physical supports you cut away by isolating the body in step 1. All particle supports are some type of two-force members with tension or compression reaction forces. These reactions will all be concurrent with the body loads from Step 2. Label each reaction with a descriptive variable name and a clear arrowhead. Again, if a vector’s direction is unknown, just assume one.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Label the diagram.</em> Verify that every dimension, angle, force, and moment is labeled with either a value or a symbolic name if the value is unknown. In our eyes, dimensioning is optional. Having the information needed for your calculations is helpful, but don’t clutter the diagram up with unneeded details. Your final free-body diagram should be a stand-alone presentation and is the basis of your equilibrium equations.</div></li>
