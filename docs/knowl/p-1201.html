<div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">method of sections</dfn> is used to solve for the unknown forces within specific members of a truss without solving for them all. The method involves dividing the truss into sections by cutting through the selected members and analyzing the section as a rigid body. The advantage of the Method of Sections is that the only internal member forces exposed are those which you have cut through, the remaining internal forces are not exposed and thus ignored.</div>
