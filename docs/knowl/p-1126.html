<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">truss</dfn> is a multi-body structure made up of long slender members connected at their ends in triangular subunits. Truss members carry axial forces only. Trusses are commonly used for spanning large distances without interruption: bridges, roof systems, stadiums, aircraft hangers, auditoriums for example. They are also used for crane booms, radio towers and the like. Trusses are lightweight and relatively strong. Over the years many unique truss designs have been developed and are often named after the original designer.</div>
