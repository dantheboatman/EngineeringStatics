Normal supports (one unknown): force perpendicular to the surface. These supports include smooth surface, roller, rocker, pinned collar on a smooth rod, smooth pin in roller or slot. Two-force member supports (one unknown): tension or compression force in line with the two force member. These supports include a cable, a weightless link, or a spring with force F = k*delta (linear spring constant multiplied by the change in length from unstretched). Pin support (two unknowns): Two rectangular force components or one force at an unknown angle).This support is generally is a frictionless pin or hinge. Rough surface support (two unknowns): friction and normal forces or magnitude and direction of resultant force. This support type is a body contacting a rough surface. Fixed collar support (two unknowns): normal force and couple moment. This collar slides but cannot rotate. Fixed support (three unknowns): two rectangular force components and couple. This support is generally welded, bolted, or otherwise anchored."></div>
