<div class="para">Use your imaginary chain saw to cut the truss into two pieces by cutting through some or all of the members you are interested in. The cut does not need to be a straight line.</div>
<div class="para">Every cut member exposes an unknown internal force, so if you cut three members youâ€™ll expose three unknowns. Exposing more than three members is not advised because you create more unknowns than available equilibrium equations.</div>

<li><div class="para">Include all applied and reaction forces acting on the section, and show known forces acting in their known directions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Draw unknown forces in assumed directions and label them. A common practice is to assume that all unknown forces are in tension and label them based on the endpoints of the member they represent.</div></li>

<li><div class="para">Write out and solve the equilibrium equations for your chosen section. If you assumed that unknown forces were tensile, negative answers indicate compression.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you have not found all the required forces with one section cut, repeat the process using another imaginary cut or proceed with the method of joints if it is more convenient.</div></li>
