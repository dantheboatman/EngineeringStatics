<div class="para">Here <span class="process-math">\(a_i\)</span> represents the distance in one of the coordinate directions such as <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\bar{a}\)</span> is the mean distance in the <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> direction to the ‘middle’ of the whole object, and <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is the weighting factor. The only difference between them is the choice of weighting factor. For center of gravity, the weighting factor is the weight, for center of mass, it is the mass, for three dimensional centroids it is the volume, and for two dimensional centroids it is area.</div>
