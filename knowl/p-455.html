<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">body</dfn> is an object, possibly made up of many parts, which may be examined as a unit. In statics, we consider the forces acting on the object as a whole and also examine it in greater detail by studying each of its parts, which are bodies in their own right. The choice of the body is an engineering decision based on what we are interested in finding out. We might, for example, consider an entire high-rise building as a body for the purpose of designing the buildingâ€™s foundation, and later consider each column and beam of the structure to ensure that they are strong enough to perform their individual roles.</div>
