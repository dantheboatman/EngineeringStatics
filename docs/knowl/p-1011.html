<p>If this sounds daunting to you, don't worry!  <em class="emphasis">You don't have to do any of this while you create your first draft</em>.  Please just write! Use any tools you are comfortable with, and I (@weh) will do the initial markup to PreTeXt for you.  However, marking up the the draft is a one way trip.  After that, any further edits and improvements must be made on the PreTeXt source.   Don't spend any effort trying to make your draft look pretty because all styling will be handled by PreTeXt.</p>
