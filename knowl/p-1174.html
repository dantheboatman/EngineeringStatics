<div class="para">So finding a zero-force member in a determinate truss does not mean you can discard the member. Zero-force members can be thought of as removed from the analysis, but only for the loading you are currently analyzing. After removing zero-force members, you are left with the simplest truss which connects the reaction and applied forces with triangles. If you misinterpret the rules you may over-eliminate members and be left with missing legs of triangles or ‘floating’ forces that have no load path to the foundation.</div>
