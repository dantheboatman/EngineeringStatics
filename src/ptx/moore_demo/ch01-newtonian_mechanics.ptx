    <introduction>
      <p> A<term>body</term>, for the purposes of engineering mechanics, is a collection of matter
        that is analyzed as a single object. This can be something simple like a rubber ball, or it
        can be something made of many parts such as a car. What can count as a body and what cannot
        count as a body is dependent on the circumstances of the analysis. In some circumstances in
        engineering mechanics, it is useful to make certain assumptions about the bodies being
        analyzed. We will either need to assume the body is either rigid or deformable, and we will
        need to assume that the body is either a particle or an extended body. </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>Rigid versus Deformable Bodies</title>
      <p>
        <term>Rigid bodies</term>do not deform (stretch, compress, or bend) when subjected to loads,
        while deformable bodies do deform. In actuality, no physical body is completely rigid, but
        many bodies deform so little that this deformation has a minimal impact on the analysis. For
        this reason, we usually assume that bodies in the statics and dynamics courses are rigid. In
        the strengths of materials course we specifically remove this assumption and examine how
        bodies deform and eventually fail under loading. </p>
      <p> There is no set boundary for determining if a body can be approximated as rigid, but there
        are two factors to to look for that indicate that a rigid body assumption is not
        appropriate. First, if the body is being visibly stretched, compressed, or bent during the
        period of analysis, then the body should not be analyzed as a rigid body. Second, if the
        body has parts that are free to move relative to one another, then the body as a whole
        should not be analyzed as a rigid body (this is instead a machine, comprised of multiple
        connected bodies that will each need to be analyzed separately). </p>

      <title>Particles versus Extended Bodies:</title>
      <p>
        <term>Particles</term>are bodies where all the mass is concentrated at a single point in
        space. Particle analysis will only have to take into account the forces acting on the body
        and translational motion. Extended bodies on the other hand have mass that is distributed
        throughout a finite volume. Extended body analysis is more complex and also has to take into
        account moments and rotational motions. In actuality, no bodies are truly particles, but
        some bodies can be approximated as particles to simplify analysis. Bodies are often assumed
        to be particles if the rotational motions are negligible when compared to the translational
        motions, or in systems where there is no moment exerted on the body such as a concurrent
        force system. </p>

      <p> A<term>force</term>is any influence that causes a body to accelerate. Forces on a body can
        also cause stress in that body, which can result in the body deforming or breaking. Though
        forces can come from a variety of sources, there are three distinguishing features to every
        force. These features are the<term>magnitude</term>of the force, the<term>direction</term>of
        the force, and the<term>point of application</term>of the force. Forces are often
        represented as<term>vectors</term>(as in the diagram to the right) and each of these
        features can be determined from a vector representation of the forces on the body. </p>
    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>Magnitude</title>
      <p> The<term>magnitude</term>of a force is the degree to which the force will accelerate the
        body it is acting on and it is represented by a scalar (a single number). The magnitude can
        also be thought of as the strength of the force. When forces are represented as vectors, the
        magnitude of the force is usually explicitly labeled. The length of the vector also often
        corresponds to the relative magnitude of the vector, with longer vectors indicating larger
        magnitudes. </p>
      <p> The magnitude of force is measured in units of mass<times/>length<solidus/>time<m>^2</m>.
        In the <abbr>SI</abbr> system where mass is measured in kilograms, length in meters and time
        in seconds the most common unit of force is the Newton, where<md>
          <mrow>1 \text{N} = \dfrac{1 \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}} {\text{sec}^2}</mrow>
        </md>where one Newton is a kilogram times a meter over a second squared. This means that a
        one newton force would cause a one kilogram object to accelerate at a rate of one meter per
        second squared. </p>
      <p> In English units the most common unit is the pound (lb) where one pound is equal to one
        slug times a foot over a second squared. This means that a one pound force would cause an
        object with a mass of one slug to accelerate at a rate of one foot per second squared. </p>

      </figure>
    </subsection>
    <subsection>
      <title>Direction</title>
      <p> In addition to having magnitudes, forces also have directions. As we said before, a force
        is any influence that causes a body to accelerate. Since acceleration has a specific
        direction, force also has a specific direction that matches this acceleration. The direction
        of the force is indicated in diagrams by the direction of the vector representing the force. </p>
      <p> Direction has no units, but it is usually given by reporting angles between the vector
        representing the force and coordinate axes, or by reporting the X, Y, and Z components of
        the vector. Often times vectors that have the same direction as one of the coordinate axes
        will not have any angles or components listed. If this is true, it is usually safe to assume
        that the direction does match the direction of one of the coordinate axes. </p>
      <figure>
        <title>Vector direction indicated by an angle and by components</title>
        <caption>The magnitude and direction of a vector can be given as a magnitude and an angle of
          the vector, or by giving magnitude of the vector components in each of the coordinate
          axes.</caption>

      </figure>
    </subsection>
    <subsection>
      <title>Point of Application</title>
      <p> The point, or points, at which a force is applied to a body is important for understanding
        how the body will react. For particles, there is only a single point for the forces to act
        on, but for extended bodies there are an infinite number of possible points of application.
        Some points of application will lead to the body undergoing simple linear acceleration; some
        will exert a moment on the body which will cause the body to undergo rotational acceleration
        as well as linear acceleration. </p>
      <p> Depending on the nature of the point of application of a force, there are three general
        types of forces. These are<term>point forces</term>,<term>surface forces</term>,
          and<term>body forces</term>. Below is a diagram of a box being pulled by a rope across a
        frictionless surface. The box has three forces acting on it. The first is the force from the
        rope. This is a force applied to a single point on the box, and is therefore modeled as
        point force. Point forces are represented by a single vector. Second is the normal force
        from the ground that is supporting the box. Because this force is applied evenly to the
        bottom surface of the box, it is best modeled as a surface force. Surface forces are
        indicated by a number of vectors side by side with a profile line to indicate the magnitude
        of the force at any point. The last force is the gravitational force pulling the box
        downward. Because this force is applied evenly to the entire volume of the box, it is best
        modeled as a body force. Body forces are sometimes shown as a field of vectors as shown,
        though they are often not drawn out at all because they end up cluttering the free body
        diagram. </p>
      <figure>
        <title>Types of Forces</title>
        <caption>The box being pulled along a frictionless surface as shown above has three types of
          forces acting on it. The tension in the cable is best represented by a point force, the
          normal force supporting the box is best represented by a surface force, and the
          gravitational force on the box is best represented as a body force.</caption>

          physical system with a single point force. The diagrams on the right represent two
          equivalent free body diagrams for the same physical system with a single surface
          force.</caption>
        <image width="50%" source="images/pointofapplication.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p> We will also sometimes talk about<term>distributed forces</term>. A distributed force is
        simply another name for either a surface or a body force. </p>
      <p> The exact point or surface that the force is acting on can be drawn as either the head or
        the tail of the force vector in the free body diagram. Because of the<term>principle of
          transmissibility</term>, both options are known to represent the same physical system.

    <title>Moments</title>
    <introduction>
      <p> A<term>moment</term>(also sometimes called a torque) is defined as the "tendency of a
        force to rotate a body". Where forces cause linear accelerations, moments cause <em>angular
          accelerations</em>. In this way moments, can be thought of as twisting forces. </p>
      <figure>
        <title>The tendancy of a force to rotate a body</title>
        <caption>Imagine two boxes on an icy surface. The force on box A would simply cause the box
          to begin accelerating, but the force on box B would cause the box to both accelerate and
          to begin to rotate. The force on box B is exerting a moment, where the force on box A is
          not.</caption>

      <title>The Vector Representation of a Moment</title>
      <introduction>
        <p> Moments, like forces, can be represented as vectors and have a magnitude, a direction,
          and a "point of application". For moments however a better name for the point of
          application is the<term>axis of rotation</term>. This will be the point or axis about
          which we will determine all the moments. </p>
      </introduction>
      <subsubsection>
        <title>Magnitude:</title>
        <p> The magnitude of a moment is the degree to which the moment will cause angular
          acceleration in the body it is acting on. It is represented by a scalar (a single number).
          The magnitude of the moment can be thought of as the strength of the twisting force
          exerted on the body. When a moment is represented as a vector, the magnitude of the moment
          is usually explicitly labeled. though the length of the moment vector also often
          corresponds to the relative magnitude of the moment. </p>
        <p> The magnitude of the moment is measured in units of force times distance. The standard
          metric units for the magnitude of moments are N-m, and the standard English units for a
          moment are ft-lb. </p>
        <p>
          <men>M = F \times d</men>
        </p>
      </subsubsection>
      <subsubsection>
        <title>Direction:</title>
        <p> In a two dimensional problem, the the direction of can be thought of as a scalar
          quantity corresponding to the direction of rotation the moment would cause. A moment that
          would cause a counter-clockwise rotation is a positive moment and a moment that would
          cause a clockwise rotation is a negative moment. </p>
        <figure>
          <title>The Right Hand Rule</title>
          <caption>To use the right hand rule, align your right hand as shown so that your thumb
            lines up with the axis of rotation for the moment and your curled fingers point in the
            direction of rotation for your moment. If you do this, your thumb will be pointing in
            the direction of the moment vector.</caption>
          <image width="50%" source="images/rhr.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p> In a three dimensional problem however, a body can rotate about an axis in any
          direction. If this is the case we need a vector to represent the direction of the moment.
          The direction of the moment vector will line up with the axis of rotation that moment
          would cause, but to determine which of the two directions we can use along that axis we
          have available we use the right hand rule. To use the right hand rule, align your right
          hand as shown so that your thumb lines up with the axis of rotation for the moment and
          your curled fingers point in the direction of rotation for your moment. If you do this,
          your thumb will be pointing in the direction of the moment vector. </p>
        <p> If we look back to two dimensional problems, all rotations occur about an axis pointing
          directly into or out of the page (the z axis). Using the right hand rule,
          counter-clockwise rotations are represented by a vector in the positive z direction and
          clockwise rotations are represented by a vector in the negative z direction. </p>
      </subsubsection>
      <subsubsection>
        <title>Axis of Rotation:</title>
        <p> In engineering statics problems we can choose any point/axis as the axis of rotation.
          The choice of this point will affect the magnitude and direction of the resulting moment
          however, and the moment is only valid about that point. </p>
        <figure>
          <title>The magnitude and direction of a moment depends upon the chosen axis of
            rotation</title>
          <caption>The magnitude and direction of a moment depends upon the chosen axis of rotation.
            For example, the single force above would cause diffrent moments about Point A and Point
            B, because it would cause different rotations depending on the point we fix in
            place.</caption>
          <image width="50%" source="images/momentpoint.png"/>
        </figure>
        <p> Though we can take the moment about any point in a statics problem, if we are
            <em>adding</em> together the moments from multiple forces, all the moments must be taken
          about a <em>common axis of rotation</em>. Moments taken about different points cannot be
          added together to find a 'net moment' </p>
        <p> Additionally, if we move into the subject of dynamics, where bodies are moving, we will
          want to relate moments to angular accelerations. For this to work, we will need to take
          the moments either about a single point that does not move (such as the hinge on a door)
          or we will need to take the moments about the center of mass of the body. Summing moments
          about other axes of rotation will not result in valid calculations. </p>
      </subsubsection>
    </subsection>
    <subsection>
      <title>Calculating Moments:</title>
      <p> To calculate the moment that a force exerts on a body, we will have two main options:
          <em>scalar methods</em> and <em>vector methods</em>. Scalar methods are generally faster
        for two dimensional problems where a body can only rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise,
        while vector methods are generally faster for three dimensional problems where the axis of
        rotation is more complex. </p>

    <title>Free Body Diagrams</title>
    <introduction>
      <p> A free body diagram is a tool used to solve engineering mechanics problems. As the name
        suggests, the purpose of the diagram is to "free" the body from all other objects and
        surfaces around it so that it can be studied in isolation. We will also draw in any forces
        or moments acting on the body, including those forces and moments exerted by the surrounding
        bodies and surfaces that we removed. </p>
      <p> The diagram below shows a ladder supporting a person and the free body diagram of that
        ladder. As you can see, the ladder is separated from all other objects and all forces acting
        on the ladder are drawn in with key dimensions and angles shown. </p>

    </introduction>
    <subsection>
      <title>Constructing the Free Body Diagram</title>
      <p> The first step in solving most mechanics problems will be to construct a free body
        diagram. This simplified diagram will allow us to more easily write out the equilibrium
        equations for statics or strengths of materials problems, or the equations of motion for
        dynamics problems. </p>
      <p> To construct the diagram we will use the following process. <ol>
          <li>First draw the body being analyzed, separated from all other surrounding bodies and
            surfaces.</li>
          <li>Second, draw in all forces and moments acting <em>directly</em> on the body. Do not
            include any forces acting on the other bodies in the system.</li>
          <li>Once the forces are identified and added to the free body diagram, the last step is to
            label any key dimensions and angles on the diagram.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection>
      <title>Forces which act on objects</title>
      <p> Generally speaking, the forces which act on objects can be divided into two types: <ul>
          <li><term>Loads</term>Loads are forces which are applied to the object. Most objects are
            designed to support something, hold something up, or push or pull on something else.
            These are the loads.</li>
          <li><term>Reactions</term>Reaction forces are the forces which keep a static object from
            moving under the effect of the load.</li>
          <li><term>Body Forces</term>Body forces are actually a type of load. This term refers to
            the forces which act on the body as a whole. The most common example of a body force is
            the weight of an object. Body forces act over the entire body and are not localized to a
            specific point. In addition to weight, buoyancy and magnetic attraction are other
            examples of body forces.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p> When we discuss forces, we use a number of different terms to describe them, but for a
        given object, remember that every force is either a load, a reaction, or a body force. Some
        forces that you will encounter are: </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Gravitational Forces</term>Unless otherwise noted, the mass of an object will
              result in a gravitational weight force applied to that body. This weight is usually
              given in pounds in the English system, and is modeled as 9.81 (g) times the mass of
              the body in kilograms for the metric system (resulting in a weight in Newtons). This
              force will always point down towards the center of the earth and act on the center of
              mass of the body. </p>
            <figure>
              <caption>Gravitational forces always act downward on the center of mass.</caption>
              <image width="50%" source="images/gravityforces.png"/>
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <term>Normal Forces</term>Every object in direct contact with the body will exert a
              normal force on that body which prevents the two objects from occupying the same space
              at the same time. </p>
            <p> Note that only objects in direct contact can exert normal forces on the body. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>

        <title>Newton's First Law</title>
        <statement>
          <p> A body at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. A body in
            motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted
            upon by an unbalanced force. </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <p> This law, also sometimes called the "law of inertia", means that bodies maintain their
        current velocity unless a force is applied to change that velocity. If an object is at rest
        with zero velocity it will remain at rest until some force begins to change that velocity,
        and if an object is moving at a set speed and in a set direction it will remain at that same
        velocity until some force begins to change that velocity. </p>

        <caption>This rock is at rest with zero velocity and will remain at rest until a net force
          causes the rock to move. The net force on the rock is the sum of any force pushing the
          rock and the friction force of the ground on the rock opposing that force</caption>

      <title>Net Forces:</title>
      <p> It is important to note that the <em>net force</em> is what will cause a change in
        velocity. The net force is the sum of all forces acting on the body. For example, we can
        imagine gently pushing on the rock in the figure above and observing that the rock does not
        move. This is because we will have a friction force equal in magnitude and opposite in
        direction opposing our gentle pushing force. The sum of these two forces will be equal to
        zero, therefore the net force is zero and the change in velocity is zero. </p>

        <caption>In the absence of friction, this spinning top would continue to spin forever, but

      <p> Newton's first law also applies to moments and rotational velocities. A body will maintain
        it's current rotational velocity until a net moment is exerted to change that rotational
        velocity. This can be seen in things like toy tops, flywheels, stationary bikes, and other
        objects that will continue spinning once started until brakes or friction stop them. </p>

    <title>Newton's Second Law</title>
    <subsection>
      <title>Translational Motion:</title>
      <p> Newton's second law states that: <em>"When a net force acts on any body with mass, it
          produces an acceleration of that body. The net force will be equal to the mass of the body
          times the acceleration of the body"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <men>F=ma</men>
      </p>
      <p> You will notice that the force and the acceleration in the equation above are written in
        bold. This means that they are vector quantities, having both a magnitude and a direction.
        Mass on the other hand is a scalar quantity having only a magnitude. Based on the above
        equation, you can infer that the magnitude of the net force acting on the body will be equal
        to the mass of the body times the magnitude of the acceleration, and that the direction of
        the net force on the body will be equal to the direction of the acceleration of the body.
      </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection>
      <title>Rotational Motion:</title>
      <p> Newton's second law also applies to moments and rotational velocities. The revised version
        of the second law equation states that the net moment acting on the object will be equal to
        the second mass moment of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation (I) times the
        angular acceleration of the body. </p>
      <p>
        <men>F= I \alpha</men>
      </p>
      <p> You should again notice that the moment and the angular acceleration of the body are bold,
        indicating that they are vector quantities, having both magnitude and direction. The mass
        moment of inertia on the other hand is a scalar quantity having only a magnitude. The
        magnitude of the net moment will be equal to the mass moment of inertia times the magnitude
        of the angular acceleration, and the direction of the net moment will be equal to the
        direction of the angular acceleration. </p>

  <section xml:id="thirdlaw">
    <title>Newton's Third Law</title>
    <p> Newton's Third Law states <em>"For any action, there is an equal and opposite
        reaction."</em> By "action" Newton meant a force, so for every force one body exerts on
      another body, that second body exerts a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction back
      on the first body. Since all forces are exerted by bodies (either directly or indirectly), all
      forces come in pairs, one acting on each of the bodies interacting. </p>
    <figure>
      <title>Earth and Moon</title>
      <caption>The gravitational pull of the earth and moon represent a Newton's Third Law pair. The
        earth exerts a gravitational pull on the moon, and the moon exerts an equal and opposite
        pull on the earth.</caption>
      <image width="50%" source="images/earthandmoon.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p> Though there may be two equal and opposite forces acting on a single body, it is important
      to remember that each of the forces a Third Law pair acts on a separate body. This can
      sometimes be confusing when there are multiple Third Law pairs at work. Below are some
      examples of situations where multiple Third Law pairs occur. </p>
    <figure>
      <title>A volleyball resting on a surface</title>
      <caption>This volleyball resting on a surface has two pairs of Third Law forces. The first
        consists of the gravitational forces (one force on the ball and one force on the ground).
        The second consists of the normal forces at the point of contact (one force on the ball and
        one force on the ground).</caption>

      <caption>If we ignore the weight of the two objects, this clamp will also have two pairs of
        Third Law forces. The first will be a set of normal forces at the top point of contact (one
        force on the wood and one force on the clamp) and the second will be another set of normal
        forces at the bottom point of contact (one force on the wood and one force on the
