<div class="para">Three-dimensional problems are usually solved using vector algebra rather than the scalar approach used in the last section. The main differences are that directions are described with unit vectors rather than with angles, and moments are determined using the vector cross product rather scalar methods. Because they have more possible unknowns it is harder to find efficient equations to solve by hand. A problem might involve solving a system of up to six equations and six unknowns, in which case it is best solved using linear algebra and technology.</div>
