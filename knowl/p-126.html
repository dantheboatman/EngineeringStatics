<div class="para">A coordinate system gives us a frame of reference to describe a system that we would like to analyze. In statics we normally use <dfn class="terminology">orthogonal</dfn> coordinate systems, where orthogonal means “perpendicular.” In an orthogonal coordinate system the coordinate direction are perpendicular to each other and thereby independent. The intersection of the coordinate axes is called the <dfn class="terminology">origin</dfn>, and measurements are made from there. Both points and vectors are described with a set of numbers called the <dfn class="terminology">coordinates</dfn>. For points in space, the coordinates specify the distance you must travel in each of the coordinate directions to get from the origin to the point in question. Together, the coordinates can be thought of as specifying a <dfn class="terminology">position vector</dfn>, a vector from the origin directly to the point. The position vector gives the magnitude and direction needed to travel directly from the origin to the point.</div>
