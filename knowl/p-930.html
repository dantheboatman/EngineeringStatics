<div class="para">Evaluating the moment at point <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> was an arbitrary choice. Any other point would give the same result. For example, in the original situation (a) force <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> makes a clockwise moment <span class="process-math">\(M=P\ell\)</span> about the midpoint. When the force is moved to the center <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> creates no moment there, so a clockwise compensatory couple with a magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(P\ell\)</span> must be added to maintain equivalence. This is the same result as we found previously (d). The compensatory couple has been drawn centered around the midpoint, but this too is arbitrary because concentrated moments are free vectors and can be placed at any location.</div>
