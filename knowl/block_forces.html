It is on a rough surface. The force pulling the box is a point force (e.g., a cable). There is also a normal reaction of the surface on the bottom surface of the box (F_N is perpendicular to the surface). As the box is pulled towards the reader, a frictional force is developed that is parallel to the surface and opposite the direction of motion. The weight of the box is represented as a force going down. In reality, the weight of the box is distributed across the entire surface of contact, as is the normal force."></div>
