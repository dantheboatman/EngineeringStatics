<div class="para">To get a feel for how reaction couples engage, pick up your laptop or a heavy book and hold it horizontally with your left hand. Can you feel your hand supplying an upward force to support the weight <em class="emphasis">and</em> a counter-clockwise reaction couple to keep it horizontal? Now add a similar support by gripping with your right hand. How do the forces and couple-moments change? You should have felt the force of your left hand decrease as your right hand picked up half the weight, and also noticed that the reaction couple from your left hand was no longer needed.</div>
