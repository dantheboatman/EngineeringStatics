<div class="para">As stated above, when working in three dimensions you need three angles to determine the direction of the vector, namely, the angle with respect to the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis, the angle with respect to the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis and the angle with respect to the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis. The three angles mentioned above are not necessarily located in any of the coordinate planes. Think of it this way — three points determine a plane, and in this case, the three points are: the origin, the tip of the vector, and a point on an axis. The plane made by those three points is not necessarily the <span class="process-math">\(xy\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(yz\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(xz\)</span> plane. It is most likely a “tilted” plane.</div>
