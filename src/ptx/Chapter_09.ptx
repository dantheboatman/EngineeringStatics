  <title>Friction</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Friction is a force which resists any relative motion between surfaces in contact with each other.  To this point we have only discussed cases where the friction could be safely ignored or had no impact on the situation, however there are many interesting situations in statics including impending motion, wedges, screws, belts, bearings, and rotating discs where friction must be taken into account.  These are the subject of this chapter.</p>

    <introduction>
      <p>There are multiple types of friction, including:
<ol><li>Dry friction: the force that opposes one solid surface sliding across another solid surface.</li><li>Fluid friction: the friction between layers of a viscous fluid in motion.</li><li>Internal friction: the force resisting internal deformation of a solid material.</li></ol>
         </p>
      <p>Statics focuses on dry friction. Dry friction occurs between two surfaces in contact and always acts in the direction which opposes the relative motion of the contact surfaces. We can represent this distributed force as a concentrated friction force. Depending on the details of the situation, dry friction can hold the object in equilibrium or cause it to accelerate or decelerate.  In <em>Statics</em> we are only concerned with objects in equilibrium; accelerating and decelerating objects will be covered in another course. </p>
      <p>Consider the football training sled shown in <xref ref="sled_AA"/>.  Prior to use, the weight of the sled is supported by a normal force directly underneath the center of gravity, and the frictional between the ground and the sled is zero.  When players push to move the sled to the right, dry friction will develop along the bottom surface of the sled in order to prevent the sled from sliding to the right.  This frictional force is represented as a point normal force, offset from the center of gravity of the sled. This offset is required to maintain rotational equilibrium given the pushing force.  If the pushing force is large enough, equilibrium will break and the sled will begin to slide to the right.</p>

      <p>The friction forces acting on the motorcycle in <xref ref="cycle_BB"/> are more complicated.  Both wheels rotate clockwise, but the rear wheel is driven by the engine and chain, while the front wheel is rotated by the road friction.  The friction force on the rear tire acts to the right and is what allows the bike to maintain speed or accelerate. The dry friction on the front tire acts to the left and retards the motion of the motorcycle.</p>

        <title>Statically Equivalent Loadings</title>
        <p>For computational simplicity we can decompose the force on an object being pushed across the ground into a vertical <em>normal</em> force and a horizontal <em>friction</em> force, as shown in the third <acro>FBD</acro> below. In reality, the force acting on an object  approximates the non-vertical distributed force shown in the first <acro>FBD</acro> below.  The second <acro>FBD</acro> shows the intermediate step. </p>

      <title>How can you tell from a problem statement which phase of friction to use?</title>
      <p>The most commonly used model for dry friction is Coulomb friction, which includes phases (as shown in <xref ref="function_CC"/> below): (1) static but not impending friction, (2) impending motion, and (3) kinetic friction. Coulomb friction relies on a friction coefficient <m>\mu</m> to serve as the proportionality constant between the normal and friction forces. The friction coefficient \mu is always greater than 0 and commonly less than 1. The friction coefficient can be greater than 1 for materials that exhibit positive adhesion to each other (like silicone rubber or glued surfaces).</p>

		  <description>Book resting on table with force being applied horizontally to the right on the book. The graph shows that the friction force equals the push force, increases as the push force on the book increases up until it reaches mu_static*N. Then, the push force reduces to mu_kinetic*N.</descriptionn>
        </image>
      </figure>
      <p/>
      <p>    Here is a more detailed discussion of what happens in each friction phase.
<ol><li>	At the origin of the graph in <xref ref="function_CC"/>, there is material interaction between the book and table, thus a friction force is available, but not engaged <m>F_f=F_\text{push}=0</m>.</li><li>	Assuming the pushing force <m>F_\text{push}</m> gradually increases from zero in this static-but-not-impending phase, the friction force increases proportionally to keep the forces balanced and the box static <m>F_f=F_\text{push}</m>. </li><li>	Next, the maximum friction possible is reached at impending motion and the pushing force matches the maximum friction force <m>F_{f_\text{max}}=\mu_\text{s} N</m>. </li><li>	Finally, if the pushing force is increased beyond impending motion, the book starts to move under the influence of kinetic friction <m>F_{f_\text{max}}=\mu_k N</m>. </li></ol>
         </p>
      <p>Notice that impending motion friction is always greater than kinetic friction, this is because the coefficient <m>\mu_\text{s} \gt \mu_k</m> for most materials. Practically, this tells us that once a material starts to move it is easier to keep moving than it was to get it started from rest. </p>
      <p>If you wonder why we include kinetic friction in a statics course, remember that a body in equilibrium might be moving with constant velocity.</p>
      <p>The key to deciding what type of friction is appropriate for a given problem will depend on the specifics of the problem statement.</p>

      <title>Normal Forces</title>
      <p>	Commonly on two dimensional problems, normal forces are represented at the point of contact or in the middle of the contacting surface. However, normal forces are rarely point loads but instead are loads distributed across a surface. The point force vector we typically represent as a normal force on an <acro>FBD</acro> is the externally equivalent resultant of the distributed normal force (as demonstrated in <xref ref="Chapter_07"/>, distributed loads). To demonstrate this further, take a look at <xref ref="resultant_CC"/>.</p>
      <figure xml:id="resultant_CC">
        <caption>
(A) A box at rest has a uniformly distributed normal force along the bottom of the box. Hence, the resultant normal force is located directly below the weight force, and the friction force (while available) is not engaged.  (B) As a pushing force<m> F_\text{push}</m> is applied, the distributed normal force changes shape, and the resultant normal force <m>N</m> is shifted to the right to maintain equilibrium. (C) This trend continues as you push harder on the box as the normal force continues to shift right.

    <p>In this section, a block is defined as any rectangular rigid body. A wedge is a tapered object that forces objects apart or holds something in place. Wedges are used in two primary ways:</p>
    <p><em>	Low friction wedges</em> are a simple machine which allows users to create large normal forces to move objects with comparatively small input forces.</p>
    <p><em>	High-friction (self-locking) wedges</em> control the location of or hold things in place (as in doorstop wedges or carpentry wedges).</p>

A hydraulic ram is used to push a stationary wedge into the through a piece of firewood. All forces are drawn with respect to forces on the log and there would be mirrored friction and normal forces on the other side of the splitter.

    <p>Luckily the free-body diagrams and computations associated with both low- and high-friction wedges are identical. Block and wedge friction problems are quite similar to the multi-force body equilibrium problems from <xref ref="Chapter_05"/> Rigid Body Equilibrium and <xref ref="Chapter_06"/> in the Frames and Machines section. The main difference is the inclusion of friction from all non-smooth contact surfaces. The directions of both the normal and friction forces on the free-body diagrams are defined below.</p>
    <p><em>Normal forces</em> act between bodies are reactions forces perpendicular to the contacting surfaces. All normal forces on a <acro>FBD</acro> should be pointing at (and not away from) the body. </p>
    <p><em>Friction forces</em> are reaction forces between bodies parallel (or tangential) to the contacting surfaces and created by the roughness of both surfaces. All friction forces on an <acro>FBD</acro> should resist the motion at the point of contact.</p>
    <p>	The key added challenge of solving wedge problems is that the angled faces of wedges create additional force components in your equations. One of the critical steps to solve a block or wedge problem is to look at the problem statement and drawing to determine which force is engaging the friction of the system. Start by drawing the friction forces on the body where this force acts (see <xref ref="wedge_EE"/>). As you are passing the friction and normal forces to adjacent <acro>FBDs</acro>, do not forget to draw both friction and normal forces in the opposite direction.</p>
    <figure xml:id="wedge_EE">

This figure demonstrates the free-body diagrams to find the minimum <m>P_1</m> to raise the block. We would assume that all the friction forces are pushed to impending motion, thus can use <m> F=\mu_\text{s} </m> to relate the friction and normal forces at all contact surfaces. A detail of <m> N_2</m> and <m> F_2</m> has also been provided so that you can see how the angle <m>\theta</m> is incorporated into the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components.

      <title>Failure in Engineering </title>
      <p>The goal of engineering design is to forecast and plan for all the ways that something can fail. The challenge is to know the questions to ask and the data to gather to model all possible failure modes. The controlling failure is the mode which occurs at the smallest load.</p>
    </insight>
    <p>This section focuses on the various ways a rigid body in equilibrium might begin to move.  The point at which an object starts to move is called the point of impending motion. </p>
    <p>The interactive in <xref ref="ggb_slip_tip"/> shows a box sitting on a rough surface.  Imagine that we start pushing on the side of the box with a gradually increasing force.  Initially, friction between the block and the incline will increase to maintain equilibrium, and the box will sit still.</p>
    <p>As we continue to increase the force there are two possibilities;  the maximum static friction force will be reached and the box will begin to slide, or the pushing force and the friction force will create a sufficient couple to cause the box tip on its corner.</p>

    <p>One of the most straightforward ways to determine how the box will move is to solve for the pushing force twice, once assuming slipping and a second time expecting tipping. Whichever iteration requires the least pushing force is the option that will cause the box to move. This process is summarized in the following three steps:</p>
    <p>This process is summarized in the following three steps:
  <ol><li><title>Check slipping</title><p>Create an <acro>FBD</acro> with the normal force <m>N</m> at some unknown location and solve for the pushing force necessary to make the body slip. </p><figure xml:id="slip_GG"><caption>
A body will slide across a surface if the pushing force exceeds the maximum static friction force that can exist between the two surfaces in contact. As in all dry friction problems, this limit to the friction force is equal to the static coefficient of friction times the normal force between the body (<m>F=\mu_\text{s} N</m>). Given the scenario below of a box on a horizontal surface, if the pushing force exceeds the maximum force of friction, then the body will slip.

Given the box on a rough horizontal surface above, as we push horizontally on the body, the resultant normal force will shift to the right. Because the normal force is the direct result of physical contact, we cannot move the normal force beyond the corner of the box. At tipping, the friction force is static-but-not-impending as it has not reached impending motion for slipping.

      <title>Screw motion and the Right-hand-rule</title>
      <p>Most screws are right-hand threaded, which means that when you are looking at the head of a screw and rotate the top of the screw to the right, it tightens (commonly taught as <q>righty-tighty</q>). Another way to think about the relationship between screw rotation and motion uses the right-hand rule. When you make a thumbs up with your right hand, if you rotate a screw towards your fingertips (clockwise = CW), then the screw will move in the direction of your thumb (as shown in <xref ref="screw_rhr"/>). Of course, the reverse is true as well if you want to loosen the screw from its nut.</p>
      <p/>
      <figure xml:id="screw_rhr">
        <caption>
This figure demonstrates the movement of a right-hand threaded screw through a fixed nut. First, make a thumbs up with your right hand. To tighten/lower the screw, rotate the screw in the direction of your fingertips (CW and blue rotational arrows). To loosen/raise the screw, point your right thumb upwards and rotate the screw in the direction of your fingertips (CCW and direction of blue rotational arrows).

		  <description>Twisting a screw clockwise tightens the screw, which agrees with the right hand rule, i.e. curling fingers of right hand in the direction of the tightening places points the thumb down in the direction the screw moves as tightened. The reverse is also true.</description>

      <p>Note that there is a small percentage of screws that are left-hand threaded. Their application is often related to:
<ul><li>machines where the reverse-threading prevents them from loosening gradually under the torque of the moving part (like the left pedal on a bicycle)</li><li>machines where the movement of the screw creates dual motion (like a hand-screw wood clamp)</li><li>situations where you do not want to mix up constituents (like the oxygen and acetylene tanks on a cutting torch)</li></ul>

      <title>Screw thread properties</title>
      <p>	For computational simplicity, all screw problems in this course will focus on square-threaded screws. Note that other threading shapes (like Acme or Trapezoidal threads) are also common, but their angled threads increase the computational complexity. The easiest way to analyze a square-thread power screw system is to turn the problem into a two-dimensional problem by "unwrapping" the ramp from around the cylinder of the shaft. We can summarize the geometry of the screw using two values (1) the mean radius of the screw (r) and secondly the lead (l) (also called the pitch), which is the distance between two adjacent threads. Alternately, you can compute the lead by computing the inverse of the threads-per-inch or centimeter. With a single thread design, this will also be the number of times the thread wraps around the screw in one inch/centimeter. </p>

        <title>Absolute vs. Relative Motion of Screw and Nut</title>
        <p>Thinking Deeper - Absolute vs. Relative Motion of Screw and Nut [box]</p>
        <p>As we have seen, screws typically rotate but can be designed to for the screw or nut to translate depending on the intended use. To better understand the use of screws and nuts, it is valuable to learn about the differences between absolute and relative motion. Absolute motion is the motion you observe from a stationary reference point. The speed of a car or the velocity of the wind are all typically measured from an absolute (or non-moving) reference frame. When we choose to measure the same terms from a moving reference frame, they are considered relative motion terms. For example, the velocity of a car relative to a moving train is a relative velocity term. We typically label absolute velocity with a single variable subscript, like the velocity of car <m>C</m> could be written <m>\vec{v_C}</m>. Relative velocities we write with a slash between the two moving objects, like a fraction in the subscript. So, the velocity of the car <m>C</m> relative to the moving train <m>T</m> is written <m>\vec{v_{C/T}}</m>. The relationship between the absolute and relative velocities of two particles can be written as: </p>
        <p>
          <md>
            <mrow>\vec{v}_C=\amp \vec{v}_T-\vec{v}_{C/T} \text{ or } </mrow>
            <mrow>\vec{v}_{C/T}\amp =\vec{v}_C - \vec{v}_T</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>The relative motion of a fixed object can also be measured from the reference frame of a moving object. Thus, we find that the stop sign’s relative velocity with respect to a moving car is equal and opposite to the car’s absolute velocity.</p>
        <p><me> \vec{v}_{S/C} =\vec{v}_S-\vec{v}_C </me> but since the velocity of the stop sign is zero, <me>\vec{v}_{S/C} =-\vec{v}_C</me>.</p>
        <p/>
        <p>The same concept can be applied to screws and nuts. In a system where a screw both translates and rotates, but the nut is stationary, you would find that the relative translation direction of the nut is equal and opposite to the absolute translation of the screw. We will use relative motion for this and other friction topics in Statics also heavily in Dynamics. </p>

      <p>To evaluate flexible belt friction, we start a flat, massless belt passing over a cylindrical surface. If we have an equal tension at each end of the belt, the belt experiences a distributed normal force, which varies as a function of the angle between the contact surface of the belt and the direction the belt tension forces are pulling (<xref ref="belt_MM"/>). </p>

      <p>When analyzing systems with belts, we are usually interested in the range of values for the tension forces where the belt does not slip relative to the surface. Starting with the smaller tension force on one side <m>\vec{T}_\text{S}</m> we can increase the second tension force <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> to some maximum value before slipping. For a flat belt, the maximum value for <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> depends on the magnitude of <m>\vec{T}_\text{S}</m>, the static coefficient of friction between the belt and the surface, and the contact angle between the belt and the surface <m>\beta</m> given in radians.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="finding-contact-angle">
      <title>Finding the contact angle <m>\beta</m>
         </title>
      <p>On flexible belt problems, you need to translate the geometry of the incoming angles of each belt into a contact angle <m>\beta</m> between the belt and pulley. The easiest way to do this is to create one or more right triangles using the incoming and outgoing belt paths and work through the various complementary angles to transfer the belt geometry into a contact angle <m>\beta</m> (see example in <xref ref="ggb_fzgfuyex"/>). There is no simplified rule for transferring cable angles over to the contact angle <m>\beta</m>, but in general, extend radial lines from the center of the pulley out to the belt’s tangential lines. Next, create right triangles with each radial line and work to find all the angles which add up to the contact angle <m>\beta</m>.</p>

      <p>Another challenging step in solving flexible belt friction problems is determining which belt has a larger tension <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> and which has the smaller tension <m>\vec{T}_\text{S}</m>. Unlike guessing the direction of unknown support forces, this is not a decision that you can make incorrectly and later learn of your error with a negative value; hence we will guide you through two ways to make this decision up-front.</p>

        <p>Draw   <acro>FBDs</acro> and sum tension along the cable.

        <title>Friction in V-belts</title>
        <p>	V-belts fit into a groove on a pulley and thereby increases the normal force of contact with the pulley sides (see <xref ref="belt_TT"/> below). This increase in normal force sequentially increases the contact friction. The belt must only contact the sides and not the groove base to maintain this friction advantage. </p>

A V-belt’s <q>enhanced</q> friction comes from the increased normal forces, which are a function of the groove angle <m>\alpha</m>. The sum of the normal force vertical components is the same for a flat belt or V-belt. However, the horizontal components of the normal forces in a V-belt, effectively pinch the belt, thereby increasing the available friction force.

        <p>	As we can see from the equation above, steeper sides to the groove (corresponding to a smaller groove angle <m>\alpha</m>) result in an increased potential difference in the tension forces. The trade-off with steeper sides, however, is that the belt becomes wedged more firmly in the groove and requires a higher force to unwedge itself as it leaves the pulley. This unwedging force decreases the efficiency of the belt-driven system. An alternate design choice would be a chain-driven system which carries very high-tension differences more efficiently.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>	The first step in determining the maximum moment (or torque) that can be transmitted in the belt drive is to determine the maximum possible value for <m>\vec{T}_\text{L}</m> before slipping occurs at either the input or output pulley. To start this process, we you will need to start by solving for the resting tension. This resting tension is the tension the belts prior to anything moving or power transfer (analogous to the tension in your bike chain when it is at rest). Practically, if you wish to increase or decrease the resting tension, many machines have adjustments to increase or decrease the distance between the pulleys slightly. If we turn on the machine and increase the moments on both pulleys, the resting tension <m>\vec{T}_\text{S}</m> remains constant while the tension on the drive side <m>\vec{T}_\text{L} </m> increases. </p>
        <p>	If the pulleys are the same material (and therefore the same coefficients of friction), it can be assumed that the belt will first slip at the smaller of the two pulleys as the smaller pulley has a smaller contact angle <m>\beta</m>.</p>
        <p>	Once we have the maximum value for <m>\vec{T}_\text{L} </m> , we can use that to find the maximum input and output moments. Next, to find the torque, we then find the net moment exerted by the two tension forces, where the radius of the pulley is the moment arm.</p>
        <p>	The maximum input torque <m>M_i</m> before slipping is</p>
        <p>
          <me>M_\text{i} = (T_\text{Lmax}-T_\text{S})r_\text{input}</me>
        </p>

        <p>	The maximum output torque M_o before slipping is</p>
        <p>
          <me>M_\text{o} = (T_\text{Lmax}-T_\text{S})r_\text{output}</me>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>	To find the maximum power we can transfer with the belt drive system, we will use the rotational definition of power, where the power is equal to the torque times the angular velocity in radians per second. Unlike the torque, the power at the input and the output will be the same, assuming no inefficiencies. <men>P_\text{max} = M_\text{i} (\omega_\text{input}) = M_\text{o} (\omega_\text{output})</men>

      <p>A bearing is a machine element used to support a rotating shaft. Bearing friction is the friction that exists between the rotating shaft and the supporting bearing. Though many types of bearings exist (journal, ball, roller, hydrodynamic), in this course, we only focus on dry friction journal bearings. Most bearings are lubricated and thus require knowledge of fluids to analyze, but dry friction journal bearings have a single contact point between the shaft and bearing  (as shown in <xref ref="journal_XX"/> below). While the single contact point makes them solvable in statics, the single contact point would be subject to wear and heat build-up if used for long-duration motion; thus, the use of journal bearings is only advisable in situations where there is limited motion.</p>

      <p>Now that you have learned the underlying physical interaction between a shaft and journal bearing, let us transition to the forces which support this interaction. If we create <acro>FBDs</acro> s for the shaft in all three cases presented in <xref ref="journal_XX"/> above, we see a combination of a normal force <m>\vec{N}</m> and a friction force <m>\vec{F}</m> at each contact point (in <xref ref="journal_YY"/> below).</p>

The shafts in the three journal bearings above can be turned into <acro>FBDs</acro> s by replacing the bearing and contact point with the forces which act through the contact point. Note in all three cases the normal force <m>\vec{N}</m> perpendicular to the tangential line of contact, which makes its line of action a radial line through the center of each shaft. Additionally, (left) there is no friction engaged, (middle) the friction resists the CW moment, and (left) the friction resists the CCW moment. The friction circle (radius <m>r_f</m>) is explained in the steps below

      <p>The most straightforward process to accurately relate the normal and friction forces for a journal bearing is by performing the following steps:
<ol><li>	First, assume for measured distances that the shaft and bearing opening have the same radius, but always draw the shaft a bit smaller so you can see its contact point with the bearing. Drawing them the same size will make it look like the shaft and bearing are in contact all the way around, which would violate our assumption of a single point of contact. </li><li>	Next, combine the normal and friction forces into a single friction resultant force (as presented in the first section of this chapter) <me>\vec{R}=\vec{F}+\vec{N}</me>. </li><li>	The friction resultant can then be assumed to be tangential to a <q>friction circle.</q> The friction circle is an imaginary circle of radius <m>r_f</m> around the center of the shaft and is a function of the radius of the shaft (r) and the friction angle <m>\phi_s</m>. <me>r_f=r \sin \phi_\text{s} \text{ where, } \phi_\text{s} =\tan^{-1} \mu_\text{s}</me>
               </li><li>	Finally, draw your <acro>FBD</acro> of the shaft (and/or bearing) with all applied loads and the friction resultant <m>\vec{R}</m> and then use your equations of equilibrium to solve the problem.</li></ol>

        <title> Finding the direction of shift for contact point</title>
        <p>If you are still struggling to determine the direction of the contact point shift, try this rule:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The contact point always shifts in the direction of the impending motion of the bearing.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The impending motion can be absolute (in the case of a fixed shaft and rotating bearing) or relative (in the case of a fixed bearing). Remember, the relative motion of the bearing is always opposite the absolute impending motion of the shaft.</p>

      <p>Disc friction is the friction that exists between a rotating body and a stationary surface.

Disc friction is applicable to a wide variety of designs including end bearings, collar bearings, disc brakes, and clutches.</p>

      <title>Collar bearing with a hollow circular contact area</title>
      <p>To start our analysis of disc friction we will use the example of a collar bearing, which has a hollow circular contact area between the rotating collar and the stationary surface (<xref ref="disk_QQ"/>). In this type of bearing, we will have a rotating shaft traveling through a hole in a surface. The shaft is supporting some load force as shown and a collar is used to support the shaft itself.</p>

      <p/>
      <p>The friction force at any point in the contact area will be equal to the normal force at that point times the kinetic coefficient of friction at that point. If we assume a uniform pressure between the collar and the surface and a uniform coefficient of friction, then we will have the same friction force exerted at all points. This does not translate however into an equal moment exerted by each point. Points further from the center of rotation will exert a larger moment than points closer to the center of rotation because they will have a larger moment arm.</p>
      <figure xml:id="disk_RR">
        <caption>
The friction forces on any differential element are assumed to be the same (due to a uniformly distributed normal force), yet elements along the outside edge of the contact area will cause a larger moment than those in the inside edge due to a greater radius.   </caption>

      <p/>
      <p>To determine the total moment exerted by the friction forces, we will need to integrate the friction from all elements of the contact area. The moment of each element (<m>dM</m>) will be equal to the product of the kinetic coefficient of friction (<m>\mu_k</m>), the normal force pressure (<m>p</m>), the distance from that point to the center of rotation (<m>r</m>), and the area of each element (<m>dA</m>). <me>dM=\mu_k  p r\; dA</me>
         </p>
      <p>The total friction moment can be found by integrating the moment of each element over the contact area:  <me>M=\int_A dM=\int_A \mu_k p r \; dA</me>
         </p>
      <p/>
      <p>To simplify the equation we can move the constant coefficient of friction and the constant normal force pressure term outside of the integral. We can also replace the pressure term with the applied force on the bearing over the contact area. Finally, so that we can integrate over the range of <m>R</m> values, we can recognize that the rate of change in the area (<m>dA</m>) for the hollow circular areas is simply the rate of change of the <m>r\;dr</m> term time the circumference of the circle at <m>r</m>. These changes lead to the equation below. <me>M=\mu_k\left ( \frac{F}{\pi(r_\text{o}^{2}-r_\text{i}^{2})} \right )\int_{r_\text{i}}^{r_\text{o} }r\; (2\pi r)\;dr</me>
         </p>
      <p/>
      <p>Finally, we can evaluate the integral from the inner radius to the outer radius. If we evaluate the integral and simplify we will end up with the final equation below. <men>M=\frac{2}{3} \mu_k  F\left ( \frac{r_\text{o}^{3}-r_\text{i}^{3}}{r_\text{o}^{2}-r_\text{i}^{2}} \right ) </men>

      <p>In cases where we have a solid circular contact area such as with a solid circular shaft in an end bearing or with the orbital sander shown at the top of the page we simply set the inner radius to zero and we can simplify the formula. If we do so, the original formula is reduced to the equation below. <men>M=\frac{2}{3} \mu_k F r_\text{o}</men>

      <p>However, disc brakes, due to their smaller contact area, have both smaller area over which to exert friction force and also higher pressure for the same applied force. In the end, these factors cancel each other out and we end up with the same formula we had for the hollow circular contact area (independent of <m>\theta</m>).  </p>

      <p>Most disc brakes, however, have a pair of pads (one on each side of the rotating disc), so we will need to double the moment in our equation for the usual pair of pads.</p>
