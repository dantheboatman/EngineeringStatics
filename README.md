# Engineering Statics Landing page.

The source for the landing page Jekyll source is in this folder.  The landing page is built using jekyll.

Render the source into html and place it into /statics/site with the command `bundle exec jekyll build`

Use `pretext deploy` to combine the landing page files, the book files, and the pdf version into output/stage, and then automatically push them  in the gh-pages branch to update the engineeringstatics.org site.

Use `pretext deploy --stage-only` to see the results without uploading them to github pages.
