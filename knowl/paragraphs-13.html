<section class="paragraphs"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Replacing a couple with couple-moment or vice-versa.</span></h3> <div class="para">A <em class="emphasis">couple</em>, defined as “two equal and opposite forces with different lines of action,” produces a pure turning action that is equivalent to a concentrated moment, called the <em class="emphasis">couple-moment</em>. Couples and couple-moments have no translational effect. Couple-moments are free vectors, which means that they are not bound to any point. Their external effect is on the entire body and is the same regardless of where it is applied.</div> <div class="para">This means that you are free to swap out a couple for its couple-moment, or swap a couple-moment for a couple that has the same moment, and you may put the replacement anywhere on you please and it will still be equivalent.</div> <div class="para">The diagram shows a series of equivalent transformations of a couple.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/images/equiv_couples.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="Six equivalent diagrams are shown representing a couple-moment.
