<div class="para">When players begin to push the sled, a friction force will appear along the bottom surface which opposes sliding to the right. Both the friction and normal forces can be represented by concentrated horizontal and vertical forces located to the right of the center of gravity. This offset is required to maintain rotational equilibrium against the pushing force. If the players push hard enough, equilibrium will break and the sled will begin to slide in the direction of the push. At this point static friction has transitioned to kinetic friction.</div>
