<div class="para">Letâ€™s imagine that you have gone off-roading and have managed to get your Jeep stuck in the mud. You have two basic options to get it out: you can <span class="process-math">\(pull\)</span> it out using the winch on the front bumper, or you can ask your friend to <span class="process-math">\(push\)</span> you out with his truck. Both methods (assuming that they apply forces with the same magnitude, direction and line of action) are statically equivalent, and both will equally move your vehicle forward.</div>
