<div class="para">Two identical shapes can have completely different moments of inertia, depending on how the shape is distributed around the axis. A shape with most of its area close to the axis has a smaller moment of inertia than the same shape would if its area was distributed farther from the axis. This is a non-linear effect, because when the distance term is doubled, the contribution of that element to the sum increases fourfold.</div>
