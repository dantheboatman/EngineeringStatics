<dfn class="terminology">Distributed loads</dfn> are forces which are spread out over a length, area, or volume. Most real-world loads are distributed, including the weight of building materials and the force of wind, water, or earth pushing on a surface. Pressure, load, weight density and stress are all names commonly used for distributed loads. Distributed load is a force per unit length or force per unit area depicted with a series of force vectors joined together at the top, and will be designated as <span class="process-math">\(w(x)\)</span> to indicate that the distributed loading is a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
