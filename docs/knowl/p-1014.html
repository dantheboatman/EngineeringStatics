<div class="para">The constraints are the frictionless pin at <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and the rocker at <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> The pin prevents translation but not rotation, which means two it has two unknowns, represented by either magnitude and direction, or by two orthogonal components. The rocker provides a force perpendicular to the surface it rests on, which is <span class="process-math">\(\ang{30}\)</span> from the horizontal. This means that the line of action of force <span class="process-math">\(\vec{D}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\ang{30}\)</span> from the vertical, giving us its direction but not its sense or magnitude</div>
