<div class="para">Moments are vectors and they will typically have components in the <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> directions in three-dimensional situations. The circular arrows we used to represent vectors in two dimensions are unclear in three dimensions, so moments are drawn as vectors just like force and position vectors, although you will sometimes see moments drawn with double arrowheads to differentiate them from force vectors. In three dimensions, it is usually not convenient to find the moment arm and use equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/moment-definition.html" title="Equation 4.2.1">(4.2.1)</a>, so instead we will use the vector cross product, which is easier to apply but less intuitive.</div>
