<div class="para">Simple trusses are made of all two-force members and all joints are modeled as frictionless pins. All applied and reaction forces are applied only to these joints. Simple trusses, by their nature, are statically determinate, having a sufficient number of equations to solve for all unknowns values. While the members of real-life trusses stretch and compress under load, we will continue to assume that all bodies we encounter are rigid.</div>
