<div class="para">Siri says that “The average distance from the earth to the sun is 92,958,412 miles.”</div> <div class="para">That’s a pretty exact answer. What does it mean, exactly? From what point on the earth to what point on the sun?</div> <div class="para">If the earth and sun were perfect spheres, we could use the distance between their centroids. With more information about shape and density, we could find their centers of mass and measure between those points.</div> <div class="para">The bigger problem is that this distance changes continuously as the earth revolves around the sun. How can we find an average value for something which is continuously changing?</div> <div class="para">We need to use the methods described here, integrating the distance as a function of time over the course of a year.</div>
