<div class="para">The general procedure for solving equilibrium of a particle problems in two dimensions is to:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Identify the particle.</em>  The particle will be the object or point where the lines of action of all the forces intersect.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Establish a coordinate system.</em>  Normally this will be a system with the origin at the particle and a horizontal <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis and a vertical <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis, though it may be advantageous to align one axis with an unknown.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Draw a free-body diagram.</em> The <abbr class="acronym">FBD</abbr> shows the object and all the forces acting on it, and defines the symbols we will use.  Every force should be labeled with a <em class="emphasis">roman letter</em> to represent its magnitude and, unless it aligns with a coordinate axis, a <em class="emphasis">Greek letter</em> or degree measure for its direction.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">State any given values</em> and identify the unknown values.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Find trivial angles.</em> Some angles may be easily found from the geometry of the problem.  If that is the case, draw a simple, labeled triangle and use trigonometry to determine the measure of the angle.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Count knowns and unknowns.</em> At this point you should have no more than two unknowns remaining.  If you don't, reread the problem and look for overlooked information.  When solving mechanics problems, it is always helpful to know what you know and what you are looking for and this information changes as you work through your solution.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Formulate equilibrium equations.</em> Based on the free-body diagram, and using the symbols you have selected, formulate an equilibrium equation using one of the methods described in this section.  The choice of method is up to you, and as you gain experience you will be able to identify the ‘best’ approach.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Simplify.</em> Use algebra to simplify the equilibrium equations. Get them into a form where the unknown values are alone on the left of the equals sign.  Work symbolically as long as you can and avoid the temptation to insert numeric values prematurely, because this tends to lead to errors and obscures the relationships between the forces and angles.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Substitute values for symbols.</em>  When your equilibrium equations have been fully simplified in symbolic form, pull out your calculator and substitute the known values and calculate the unknowns.  Indicate the units of your results, and underline or box your answers.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">Check your work.</em>  Have you made any algebra or trig mistakes?  If you add the forces graphically do they appear to add to zero?   Do the results seem reasonable given the situation?   Have you included appropriate units?  If you have time, work the problem using another approach and compare answers.</div></li>
