<div class="para">In mechanics we are interested in studying the forces acting on objects and in this course, the objects will be in equilibrium. The best way to do this is to draw a diagram that focuses on the forces acting on the object, not the mechanisms that hold it in place. We call this type of diagram a free-body diagram because it shows the object disconnected or freed from its supporting mechanisms. You can see the free-body diagram for this situation by moving the slider in the interactive to position two. This shows that there are two forces acting on the object; the force of the rope holding it up, and the weight of the object which is trying to pull it to earth, which we treat as acting at its center of gravity.</div>
