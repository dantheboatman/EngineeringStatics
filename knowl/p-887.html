<div class="para">An <em class="emphasis">equivalent transformation</em> occurs when a loading on an object is replaced with another loading that has the same <em class="emphasis">external</em> effect on the object. By external effect, we mean the response of the body that we can see from the outside, with no consideration of what happens to it internally. If the object is a free body, the external effect would be translation and rotation. In statics, since objects are not accelerating, the external effect really means the reactions at the supports required to maintain equilibrium. The external effects will be exactly the same before and after an equivalent transformation.</div>
